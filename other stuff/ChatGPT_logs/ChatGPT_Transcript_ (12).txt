The log files utilized for this study adhered to a specific structure, which ensured the systematic capture of critical transmission parameters. Each entry within the log files was composed of the following fields:

Timestamp: This field recorded the precise time at which the data was captured, allowing for temporal analysis of the transmission events.
Receiver: The identifier of the node that received the transmission, which is crucial for mapping the network topology and understanding the reception patterns.
Sender: The identifier of the node that transmitted the packet, providing insights into the source of the transmission within the network.
Length of Packet: This field indicated the size of the transmitted packet, which is relevant for analyzing the network's data throughput and efficiency.
RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator): The signal strength as perceived by the receiving node, which serves as an essential metric for assessing the quality and reliability of the communication link.
Transmission Power: The power level at which the sender transmitted the packet, a critical parameter for understanding the energy efficiency and range of the transmissions.
Data: This field contained the payload of the packet, representing the actual information transmitted between nodes.

    When the sender ($i)$ is able to reach the receiver ($j$) with transmission power $x$, $x$ is noted at $(i,j)$.\\

Here is a refined and formal version of the explanation with an academic tone:

This matrix represents the transmission power of the antenna between nodes in the network, where each element 
(
𝑖
,
𝑗
)
(i,j) corresponds to the transmission power required for the antenna to reach node 
𝑗
j from node 
𝑖
i. The matrix, therefore, provides a comprehensive view of the transmission dynamics between the nodes. The resulting structure is depicted in the matrix below:

\begin{blockarray}{cccccc} \text{node\_id} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \begin{block}{c[ccccc]} 0 & \text{nan} & -17 & -5 & 3 & \text{nan} \\ 1 & -17 & \text{nan} & -10 & -12 & 1.3 \\ 2 & -3 & -12 & \text{nan} & 2.3 & 3 \\ 3 & \text{nan} & \text{nan} & -17 & \text{nan} & -12 \\ 4 & 3 & -1 & -7 & -12 & \text{nan} \\ \end{block} \end{blockarray}

This matrix encapsulates three distinct cases:

Sender Equals Receiver (
𝑖
=
𝑗
i=j):
When the sender and the receiver are the same node, no transmission is required, and consequently, "nan" is recorded at 
(
𝑖

𝑗
)
(i,j) in the matrix. This is observed in the example matrix at positions

(0,0), 
(

(1,1), ..., 
(

(4,4), indicating no transmission occurs when the sender and receiver are identical.

Sender Reaches Receiver with Transmission Power 
𝑥

If the sender (
𝑖
i) successfully reaches the receiver (
𝑗
j) with a specific transmission power 
𝑥
x, the value 
𝑥
x is documented at position 
(

(i,j) in the matrix. For example, in the matrix,

17
−17, 
(
0

2

(0,2) as

−5, and so forth, indicating the respective transmission power levels between those nodes.

Sender Cannot Reach Receiver:
In scenarios where the sender (
𝑖
i) is unable to reach the receiver (
𝑗
j) with any transmission power, "nan" is recorded at 
(
𝑖
,
𝑗
)
(i,j) in the matrix. This denotes an absence of a viable transmission link between those nodes, exemplified in the matrix at positions such as 
(
0

(0,4) and 
(
3

(3,0).

This structured representation aids in visualizing and analyzing the network's transmission power requirements and capabilities between nodes.

To give the matrix a title in a LaTeX document, you can use the \caption command if the matrix is part of a table or figure, or you can manually add a title using the \textbf{} or \centerline{} commands. Here are a couple of methods:

1. Using \caption with a Table Environment:

If you want the matrix to be part of a table and have a numbered caption, use the table environment.

latex
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Transmission Power Matrix Between Nodes}
    \[
        \begin{blockarray}{cccccc}
          \text{node\_id} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
          \begin{block}{c[ccccc]}
            0 & \text{nan} & -17 & -5 & 3 & \text{nan} \\
            1 & -17 & \text{nan} & -10 & -12 & 1.3 \\
            2 & -3 & -12 & \text{nan} & 2.3 & 3 \\
            3 & \text{nan} & \text{nan} & -17 & \text{nan} & -12 \\
            4 & 3 & -1 & -7 & -12 & \text{nan} \\
          \end{block}
        \end{blockarray}
    \]
\end{table}

2. Using \textbf{} for a Simple Title:

If you prefer a simpler, non-numbered title above the matrix, you can manually add it using \textbf{} or \centerline{}.

latex
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
\centerline{\textbf{Transmission Power Matrix Between Nodes}}
\[
    \begin{blockarray}{cccccc}
      \text{node\_id} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
      \begin{block}{c[ccccc]}
        0 & \text{nan} & -17 & -5 & 3 & \text{nan} \\
        1 & -17 & \text{nan} & -10 & -12 & 1.3 \\
        2 & -3 & -12 & \text{nan} & 2.3 & 3 \\
        3 & \text{nan} & \text{nan} & -17 & \text{nan} & -12 \\
        4 & 3 & -1 & -7 & -12 & \text{nan} \\

          \end{block}
        \end{blockarray}
    \]
    \caption{Transmission Power Matrix Between Nodes}

In this setup:

The \caption command is placed directly after the matrix, ensuring that the caption appears below it.
The table environment helps in managing the placement and provides a formatted caption below the matrix.

Next I extracted the coordinates of the nodes from the the FIT/IoT-Lab and calculated the distance between each node. In this example I used 2D coordinates, whereas in the real topology the coordinates had three dimensions.\\
This distance matrix is required for calculating the gateway nodes, which are used so that for example node\_0 is still able reach node\_4. The gateways nodes are calculated by minimizing the distance from the receiver of the signal to the gateway node, while maximizing the distance from the gateway node to the sender. The algorithm also minimizes the number of hops, so it priories a node further away which has a direct connection to the sender, over a node which is closer to the sender, but has a hop.\\
I decided that the gateway algorithm should work this way, as even at the maximum transmission power of the antenna the consumption is only equal to receiving a packet and when comparing the consumption of the transmission power levels, and even though there is this exponential growth of consumption, the lowest power level is $\sim88mW$ and the highest is $\sim104mW$. Therefore the direct path is always better then over another node.\\
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \[
        \begin{blockarray}{cccccc}
          \text{node\_id} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
          \begin{block}{c[ccccc]}
            0 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 5 \\
            1 & 2 & 0 & 3 & 5 & 1 \\
            2 & 4 & 3 & 0 & 7 & 3 \\
            3 & 6 & 5 & 7 & 0 & 6 \\
            4 & 5 & 1 & 3 & 6 & 0 \\
          \end{block}
        \end{blockarray}
    \]
    \caption{Example of a distance matrix between all the nodes in the topology}
    \label{table:matrix_dist}
\end{table}

So in the case of our example, the algorithm iterates of the matrix and when it find a $"nan"$ where $i\neq j$. Then it looks for the closest node from the receiver. The closest node to node\_4 ist node\_1 with a distance 1m. Then it checks if node\_1 has a connection to node\_4, so it checks for a non-$nan$ value at $(1,4)$ in the transmission power matrix. But $(1,4) = nan$ so it looks for the next closest node which in our case is node\_2 with a distance of 3m. Now it checks for a non-$nan$ value at $(2,4)$, which returns $3$ so we know that there is a connection from node\_2 to node\_4 with power $3$.\\
Next it checks for a connection from node\_0 the sender to node\_2 the gateway. If $(0,2)$ is not $"nan"$, then it returns the path $0 \longrightarrow 2 \longrightarrow 4$. This means two transmissions are required from node\_0 to node\_2 with power $(0,2) = -5$ and from node\_2 to node\_4 with power $(2,4) = 3$.\\
Doing this algorithm results in following matrix.
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \[
        \begin{blockarray}{cccccc}
          \text{node\_id} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\

            2 & -3 & -12 & \text{nan} & 2.3 & 3 \\
            3 & (-17, -10) & -2 & -17 & \text{nan} & -12 \\
            4 & 3 & -1 & -7 & -12 & \text{nan} \\

Here is a refined and formal version of your text with an academic tone:

Next, I extracted the coordinates of the nodes from the FIT/IoT-Lab and calculated the distances between each pair of nodes. In this example, two-dimensional (2D) coordinates were used for simplicity, although the actual network topology utilized three-dimensional (3D) coordinates. The resulting distance matrix is essential for identifying gateway nodes, which facilitate communication between nodes that are not directly reachable. For instance, a gateway node enables node_0 to communicate with node_4 even when a direct transmission is not possible.

The gateway nodes are determined by minimizing the distance from the receiver of the signal to the gateway node, while simultaneously maximizing the distance from the gateway node to the sender. Additionally, the algorithm minimizes the number of hops, prioritizing nodes that are further away but have a direct connection to the sender over those that are closer but require intermediate hops.

The rationale for this approach is based on the energy consumption characteristics of the transmission power levels. Even at the maximum transmission power, the energy consumption is only marginally higher than receiving a packet. Specifically, the lowest transmission power level consumes approximately 88 mW, while the highest level consumes around 104 mW. Given this relatively small difference, a direct transmission is generally more energy-efficient than one involving intermediate nodes.

The following table illustrates an example of the distance matrix between all nodes in the network topology:

\begin{table}[h] \centering \begin{blockarray}{cccccc} \text{node\_id} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \begin{block}{c[ccccc]} 0 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 5 \\ 1 & 2 & 0 & 3 & 5 & 1 \\ 2 & 4 & 3 & 0 & 7 & 3 \\ 3 & 6 & 5 & 7 & 0 & 6 \\ 4 & 5 & 1 & 3 & 6 & 0 \\ \end{block} \end{blockarray} \caption{Example of a distance matrix between all nodes in the topology} \label{table:matrix_dist} \end{table}

In the example provided, the algorithm iterates over the transmission power matrix. When it encounters a "nan" value at 
(
𝑖
,
𝑗
)
(i,j) where 
𝑖
≠
𝑗
i

=j, it searches for the closest node to the receiver. For instance, to establish a connection from node_0 to node_4, the algorithm identifies node_1 as the closest node to node_4 with a distance of 1m. It then checks if node_1 has a connection to node_4 by examining the value at 
(
1
,
4
)
(1,4) in the transmission power matrix. Since 
(
1
,
4
)
=
nan
(1,4)=nan, the algorithm proceeds to the next closest node, which is node_2, at a distance of 3m. Finding a valid connection at 
(
2
,
4
)
=
3
(2,4)=3, the algorithm confirms a transmission path from node_2 to node_4 with power 3.

Next, the algorithm checks the connection from the sender node_0 to the gateway node_2. If 
(
0

2
)
(0,2) is not "nan", the algorithm establishes the path 
0

This sender firmware first of all enters a phase locked loop (PLL), to synchronize the internal oscillator to a reference signal to stabilize the frequency. This ensures that the radio transmitter operates at the correct frequency, to avoid errors in communication.\\
Once synchronized, the radio chip transitions to the idle state, as the transmission power can only be changed in this or the sleep state. The algorithm then changes the transmission power. Then it proceeds to call the $broadcast\_data()$ function~\ref{alg:broadcast}.

This firmware begins by entering a phase-locked loop (PLL) to synchronize the internal oscillator with a reference signal, thereby stabilizing the frequency and ensuring accurate communication.

Once synchronization is achieved, the radio chip transitions to the idle state, which is necessary for adjusting the transmission power. The algorithm then modifies the transmission power accordingly and calls the \texttt{broadcast_data()} function~\ref{alg:broadcast}. The sender broadcasts 30 packets, re-enters the idle state, switches to the next transmission power level, and repeats this cycle until all transmission power levels have been utilized.

This figure compares the transmission power level to its corresponding power consumption in milliwatts (mW). As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:consumption_s}, there is an exponential growth in power consumption as the transmission power level increases, reflecting the increased energy requirements needed to establish longer-range communication.

Additionally, Figure~\ref{fig:reached_nodes} illustrates the relationship between the number of nodes reached and the power consumption in milliwatts. The graph shows that as the transmission power level increases, the number of reachable nodes increases linearly. However, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:consumption_s}, the power consumption grows exponentially as more nodes are reached. This highlights the trade-off between reaching more nodes and the significant increase in energy consumption, which must be carefully managed in energy-sensitive IoT networks.

However, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:consumption_s}, power consumption increases exponentially as more nodes are reached. This behavior aligns with the expectations derived from the Free-Space Path Loss (FSPL) formula~\ref{sec:pathloss}, which predicts that the required transmission power to maintain a reliable communication link grows significantly with distance. As the transmission range extends to reach additional nodes, the signal strength must be amplified to overcome both free-space path loss and other environmental factors such as obstacles, interference, and attenuation. Consequently, this results in a higher energy demand for longer communication ranges, which is reflected in the exponential increase in power consumption observed in the graph. This exponential growth underscores the challenges of maintaining efficient power usage in large-scale networks with diverse connectivity requirements.

For adding the receiving power I had 3 approaches. The first approach was to ignore all receiving power so I added nothing but the transmission consumptions. The second approach was to add the receiving consumption only of the gateway node involved. And the third approach was to always add the receiving consumption. wether the connection was direct or via a gateway node.

I calculated the gateway matrix as described in section~\ref{subsec:gateway_mat}. To incorporate the receiving power into the calculations, I considered three different approaches. The first approach involved disregarding the receiving power entirely, adding only the transmission power consumption. The second approach added the receiving power consumption only for the gateway node involved in the communication. Lastly, the third approach involved adding the receiving consumption for all nodes, regardless of whether the connection was direct or passed through a gateway node.

Upon evaluating these approaches, I opted for the second approach, where the receiving power consumption was added only for the gateway node involved. This decision was made to more accurately reflect the energy consumed by the gateway node, which handles the reception of the transmission and often plays a crucial role in routing and forwarding data within the network. By limiting the receiving power consumption to the gateway node, I avoided overestimating the overall energy consumption while still accounting for the significant energy usage of the gateway nodes in the network. This approach strikes a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, aligning well with the goals of my experiment.

This decision was made to more accurately reflect the actual consumption required to reach a node, rather than the total consumption of all nodes involved in the transmission being aggregated. By focusing on the gateway node's receiving power, I could isolate the energy consumption relevant to the communication process, ensuring that the results more closely align with the actual power usage incurred during the transmission. This approach minimizes overestimations that could arise from considering the receiving power of intermediate nodes that do not play a direct role in the energy consumption related to the end-to-end communication. Additionally, it maintains a more realistic representation of the energy expenditure in scenarios where nodes relay data through a gateway. This method proved to be both efficient and precise for the objectives of this experiment, providing a clearer understanding of the power consumption dynamics within the network.

Du:
what are reason to take the third approach?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT:
ChatGPT

Choosing the third approach, where the receiving power consumption is added for all nodes involved—whether the connection is direct or via a gateway—can be justified for several reasons:

Comprehensive Energy Accounting: This approach provides a more holistic view of the total energy consumption within the network. It captures the full cost of maintaining communication paths, including both transmission and reception at each hop. This is particularly useful in scenarios where overall network energy efficiency is a priority.

Modeling Multi-Hop Scenarios: In networks where multi-hop communication is common, accounting for the receiving power at all intermediate nodes can offer insights into the energy demands of relaying data. This can help in designing energy-efficient routing protocols by highlighting the cumulative energy costs of indirect communication paths.

Network Load Analysis: By including the receiving consumption of all nodes, this method allows for a more accurate assessment of the load on each node. It can identify nodes that act as frequent intermediaries and might require optimization or load balancing to prevent excessive energy drain.

Realistic Simulation of Network Operations: In real-world deployments, all nodes along a communication path consume energy, not just the endpoints. Including the receiving power of all nodes can make simulations and models more realistic, reflecting the true operational costs in dense or busy networks.

Future-Proofing for Complex Applications: For applications that may evolve to require detailed energy monitoring or where power consumption data could influence dynamic network adjustments (e.g., adaptive routing based on node energy levels), the third approach ensures all relevant data is already being tracked.

While this approach provides a more thorough accounting of energy use, it may also introduce complexity and require careful interpretation of results to avoid overestimating the energy cost for specific communication tasks.

Figure~\ref{fig:consumption_r_s_i} compares the power consumption in mW of the idle, transmit and receive state. Obvious is that the even at maximum transmission power level the power consumption in mW is still lower as the receiver consumption.\\
Other experiments on the IoT-LAB M3 boards have shown different results, with a maximum power consumption of around 200 mW at the maximum power level. But these results were collected using Contiki as the operating system of the node. Contiki seems way less energy efficient as even the idle consumption exceeds the 110 mW whereas the idle consumption using the same resources except the operating system being Openlap are around 65 mW.\\

However, these results were gathered using Contiki as the operating system. Contiki appears to be significantly less energy efficient, with idle consumption surpassing 110 mW. In contrast, the idle consumption on the same hardware using OpenLab is around 65 mW.

Given these observations, I have chosen to use OpenLab due to its superior energy efficiency. By leveraging OpenLab, I aim to reduce the overall power consumption, which is critical for optimizing the energy efficiency of the network.

As mentioned in section~\ref{subsubsec:gateway_eval} I also used Vivaldi to determine which of the three gateway methods I want to use.\\
Figure~\ref{fig:vivaldi_gateways} shows the three different gateway setups.\\
All the results are for Vivaldi with height vectors and two diemnsions.\\
The 90th percentile error (NPRE) and the mean error (MRE) are relative high when only very few neighbors are involved and get lower with increasing number of neighbors. For each of the three gateway setups 15 neighbors seem quit optimal as the NPRE and MRE dont reduce by much further but both values are already quit low without adding much more neighbors.\\
The second setup with receiving consumption added only for the gateway nodes is definitely the worst, with an NPRE abore 1.0 so more than 100\% off and an MRE of 0.25 so 25\%.\\
The other two approaches result in roughly the same error values for NPRE and MRE. But with an NPRE of 0.5 and and MRE of 0.1 even those two approaches dont achieve great results. For the reasons stated in~\ref{subsubsec:gateway_eval} I choos the third option.\\
Vivaldi also has an option to not use the height vector which typically results in predicted coordinates which are more clustered, but therefore also the results of the prediction are much worse. To not further worsen the prediction I decided against evaluations with it.\\

As outlined in Section~\ref{subsubsec:gateway_eval}, I utilized Vivaldi to evaluate the three gateway methods and determine the most suitable approach. Figure~\ref{fig:vivaldi_gateways} presents the outcomes for the different gateway setups. All results were derived using Vivaldi with height vectors in a two-dimensional space.

The analysis reveals that both the 90th percentile relative error (NPRE) and the mean relative error (MRE) are significantly higher when only a few neighbors are considered, decreasing as the number of neighbors increases. For all three gateway configurations, involving around 15 neighbors appears to be optimal. Beyond this point, further increases in neighbors do not yield substantial reductions in NPRE and MRE, both of which are already reasonably low.

Among the three gateway setups, the second approach—where the receiving consumption is added only for the gateway nodes—performed the worst. It exhibited an NPRE exceeding 1.0 (indicating errors over 100%) and an MRE of 0.25 (25% error).

In contrast, the other two approaches delivered similar error values, with an NPRE around 0.5 and an MRE of 0.1. Despite these being relatively better, they still do not represent optimal accuracy. Based on the reasons discussed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:gateway_eval}, I selected the third option as the most balanced and effective approach.

Vivaldi also offers the option to forgo height vectors, which generally results in more clustered predicted coordinates. However, this typically leads to less accurate predictions. To avoid further degradation in prediction accuracy, I chose not to evaluate configurations without height vectors.

Therefore I took 5 measurements for each dimension up to 50 dimensions and then I took the average MRE and NPRE for 8 to 20 neighbors for each dimension.

Therefore, I conducted five measurements for each dimension up to 50 dimensions and calculated the average MRE (Mean Error) and NPRE (90th Percentile Error) for configurations with 8 to 20 neighbors. I specifically selected measurements with a minimum of 8 neighbors to reduce variability, as the error tends to be significantly higher and more variable when fewer neighbors are involved.

\begin{figure}[h] \centering \includesvg[width=1\textwidth]{./img/vivaldi/npre_mre_scatter_regression.svg} \caption{On the left, the NPRE; on the right, the MRE for each number of dimensions ranging from 2 to 50} \label{fig:vivaldi_dimension} \end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:vivaldi_dimension} illustrates that as the number of dimensions increases, the NPRE decreases, flattening around 0.45 (45%) after 15 dimensions. This behavior aligns with expectations because increasing the dimensionality allows for a more nuanced representation of node relationships, reducing the extreme errors captured by the NPRE. However, this diminishing return beyond 15 dimensions suggests that additional dimensions offer limited further improvement in capturing the 90th percentile of errors.

Interestingly, the figure also shows that the MRE is lowest with only 2-dimensional predicted coordinates, around 0.105, representing an MRE of 10.5%. After this point, the MRE increases to approximately 0.123 (12.3%) before decreasing again, flattening out around 11.2% with 20 dimensions.

The superior MRE performance with only 2 dimensions could be attributed to the simplicity and efficiency of representing network relationships in a lower-dimensional space. In two dimensions, the model may be capturing the most critical relationships without introducing the complexity and potential overfitting associated with higher dimensions. This simplicity could lead to more stable and accurate average error predictions. However, as dimensions increase, while more subtle spatial relationships are captured, the increased complexity may introduce noise, leading to slightly higher average errors before stabilizing at a higher dimensionality.

SECTION I.Introduction
A number of latency-conscious Internet applications require an efficient, scalable and light-weight service to predict the distance (a.k.a. Round Trip Time or RTT) between any two Internet hosts without explicit measurements. Examples include network monitoring [36], application layer multicast [25], [51], locality-aware server selection [51], distributed query optimization [33], BitTorrent-based file sharing [38], network modeling [49], compact routing [1], multiplayer online games [2], etc. Clearly, for a network with N hosts, active probing for all pairwise link distances which requires O(N2) measurements is not a scalable solution. Such measurements would impose heavy load on all the hosts. Hence, the research community has developed various network coordinate (NC) systems [11] that predict the distances of all N2 end-to-end links, by performing only O(N) measurements. NC systems reduce the active probing overhead significantly, which is especially beneficial to large-scale distributed applications. Besides the aforementioned applications, recently the application venues of NC systems have been expanded to cloud services [44] and social graph analysis [7], [52].

Every NC system relies on a basic model, which defines the relationship between the coordinates and the predicted distances. Most of the existing NC systems (such as GNP [31], Vivaldi [10], ICS [23], VL [41], NPS [30], PIC [8]), rely on the Euclidean distance model. These NC systems assign each host with a coordinate to represent its position in the Euclidean space, and predict distances between any two hosts by their coordinates. Unfortunately, such systems have a common drawback, i.e., the predicted distances among every three hosts have to satisfy triangle inequality, a condition that does not always hold in measured distances. Several existing studies [16], [19], [24], [42], [53] reported the wide existence of Triangle Inequality Violations (TIV) on the Internet. The wide existence of TIV leads to limited prediction accuracy of Euclidean distance model based NC systems. Consequently, the NC systems based on this model, let it be Vivaldi, PIC, NPS, or GNP, achieve similarly low prediction accuracy.

To overcome the TIV problem, which cannot be handled well by using Euclidean distance model based NC systems, the definition of matrix factorization based NC system is introduced in [29]. The key idea of matrix factorization based systems is that a large distance matrix can be approximately factorized into two smaller matrices by methods such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [18]. Thanks to the linear dependence among the rows in Internet distance matrices [23], [29], [41], such methods achieve accurate approximations. Different from Euclidean distance based NC systems, the predicted distances obtained by matrix factorization based NC systems do not have to satisfy the triangle inequality. This offers an opportunity to overcome the accuracy barrier introduced by TIV. Prior to this work, IDES [29] is the first matrix factorization model based NC system. Recently, another matrix factorization model based NC system, so-called DMF [22], is proposed using a decentralized architecture. We discuss and evaluate these existing systems in detail in Section II-C and Section II-D. According to our study, these systems cannot achieve higher prediction accuracy than Euclidean distance model based NC systems. This result is because of the propagation of the prediction error. In both IDES and DMF, every host refers to a set of reference NCs for calculating its own NC. Concretely, all reference NCs have equal impact in the calculation. Once the inaccurate NCs are referred, their errors will be propagated to the hosts which refer to them, and could be propagated even further by misleading the NCs of these hosts. Handling this issue is the main goal of our work. The intuition behind our approach is as follows: the more accurate the reference NC is, the higher confidence (i.e., weight) should be assigned to this NC, and vice versa. Therefore, the impact of relatively inaccurate reference NCs is reduced by lower assigned weights. We will examine the effectiveness of our approach and present the detailed NC system design which can significantly improve the prediction accuracy over existing approaches.

The key contributions of this paper are threefold.

We introduce a weight-based mechanism for the calculation of the matrix factorization based NC. The weight concept is introduced here to distinguish the reference NCs with high errors and low errors. Base on this mechanism, a fully decentralized NC system using matrix factorization, so-called Phoenix, is proposed.

We evaluate Phoenix extensively from two angles, i.e., overall prediction accuracy and practicality. By studying the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of relative errors, we show that Phoenix improves the prediction accuracy significantly over existing approaches. For practicality, we show that Phoenix can handle the drifts of the NCs well by utilizing regularization, while dealing with host churn using a low sampling rate. Moreover, it achieves fast convergence and robustness against measurement anomalies. We also evaluate Phoenix in a scalable network monitoring scenario, using a newly collected dynamic data set [27] which captured the RTT variations over time. According to our evaluation, Phoenix can reduce the monitoring cost by 83.92% while maintaining the 90th percentile relative error (NPRE) as 0.56. Phoenix reduces the average NPRE from Vivaldi by 35.63% and from IDES by 58.82% during the data collection period.

We study how well an NC system can characterize the wide existence of TIV on the Internet by introducing two new quantitative metrics, so-called RERPL and AERPL. We find that RERPL and AERPL of Phoenix are lower than the other selected NC systems, which means that Phoenix can characterize the TIV property better than other existing approaches.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review and evaluate the related work. Section III presents our design of Phoenix. We evaluate the performance of Phoenix and compare it with two existing approaches through extensive simulations in Section IV. In Section V, we perform analysis of TIV characterization in NC systems. We conclude the whole paper in Section VI.

Phoenix is a decentralized network coordinate (NC) system designed to improve the accuracy of distance predictions among hosts in a network by addressing the issue of Triangle Inequality Violations (TIV), which is common in traditional Euclidean distance-based NC systems like Vivaldi, PIC, and GNP. Unlike these systems, which rely on the assumption that distances between nodes satisfy the triangle inequality, Phoenix leverages a matrix factorization approach to model the network's distance matrix more accurately.

A key feature of Phoenix is its weight-based mechanism, which differentiates between reference NCs with high and low prediction errors. This allows Phoenix to assign higher confidence (weights) to more accurate reference coordinates and lower confidence to less reliable ones, reducing the propagation of errors throughout the system. This weight-based approach helps prevent the issue of error accumulation that can degrade the performance of other matrix factorization-based NC systems like IDES and DMF, where all reference coordinates are treated equally, and errors from inaccurate references are propagated.

Phoenix is designed to be fully decentralized, which means that it does not rely on a central authority for coordination or calculation. The system improves on the previous matrix factorization models by offering better prediction accuracy, especially in environments with high levels of measurement anomalies or host churn. It achieves fast convergence and robust performance even under these challenging conditions.

In practical terms, Phoenix has been shown to significantly reduce the monitoring cost in large-scale distributed applications like network monitoring. For example, in a network monitoring scenario, Phoenix achieved an 83.92% reduction in monitoring cost while maintaining a low 90th percentile relative error (NPRE) of 0.56, outperforming both Vivaldi and IDES in terms of accuracy. Phoenix also addresses the issue of TIV more effectively than other systems, as evidenced by lower values of the two new metrics introduced: Relative Error in Predicted Latency (RERPL) and Average Error in Predicted Latency (AERPL).

Overall, Phoenix's weight-based approach to matrix factorization and its ability to mitigate TIV lead to significant improvements in prediction accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared to existing NC systems.

why is DMFSGD more robust to missing data and noise. and what is meant with noise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT:
ChatGPT

DMFSGD (Decentralized Matrix Factorization with Stochastic Gradient Descent) is more robust to missing data and noise due to its decentralized, iterative approach to matrix factorization, which allows it to learn and update network coordinates (NCs) without relying heavily on complete or perfect data. The use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) enables the system to gradually converge to accurate coordinate predictions despite imperfections, by updating coordinates based on partial information and iteratively adjusting weights to minimize errors.

In the context of DMFSGD, noise refers to any form of unpredictable or irregular data that may affect the measurements or predictions. This could be caused by fluctuations in the network, inaccurate measurements, temporary outages, or erroneous data that doesn't reflect the true network conditions. Noise can introduce errors and inconsistencies in the network's performance data (such as round-trip time or distance measurements), but DMFSGD is designed to handle these disturbances effectively by relying on gradual learning, where each update considers the overall pattern rather than reacting to single outliers or small deviations. This helps mitigate the impact of noise on the model’s accuracy.

Even though these four approaches are vastly different, they perform similarly in terms of prediction accuracy. A potential reason for the inaccurate predictions could lie in the triangle inequality violation (TIV) inherent in the dataset from which the Vivaldi coordinates are predicted. The triangle inequality, which states that the sum of the distances between any two pairs of nodes should be greater than or equal to the distance between the third node, is often violated in real-world network data.

The 2-dimensional coordinates derived from Vivaldi, where the energy consumption between a pair of nodes corresponds to the Euclidean distance, form the cost space for NEMO. NEMO operates through an iterative approach encompassing three phases: 1) pre-processing, 2) virtual operator placement, and 3) re-assignment and replication.

Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_phases}(middle) demonstrates the second phase, where NEMO computes the optimal placement of a virtual node for each cluster, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Lastly, in the re-assignment and replication phase, NEMO determines the number and placement of physical nodes based on the load of each cluster. The orange cluster, with a higher load, necessitates three physical nodes, while the green cluster requires two, and both the red and blue clusters only require one physical node each, reflecting their lower load.

\subsection{Setting up NEMO+~\label{subsec:nemo_setup}}
The 2-dimensional coordinates from Vivaldi with the energy consumption between a pair of nodes being the Euclidean distance, corresponds to our cost space for NEMO+. NEMO+ operates through an iterative approach with three phases: 1) pre-processing, 2) virtual operator placement and 3) re-assignment and replication.
\subsubsection{Capacities and weights\label{subsubsec:capacities}}
In the NEMO notebooks the simulations are calculated on different capacity distributions. The individual nodes capacity will vary, but the sum of all capacities will stay the same. For my experiment I decided to use a mean capacity of 20, but the median will vary. A varying median will change NEMOs performance, but not by a significant difference, that is why I only display the results for median = 20.\\
To assess the performance of NEMO under varying loads, NEMO assigns different link weights ($w$) to sources. The first configuration is $w = 1$ for all sources, the second is $w = 2$ and for the third each source is assigned a random weight following a log-normal distribution within the range $[1,50]$.
\subsubsection{Tuning hyper-parameters\label{subsubsec:hyper_params}}
Next I have to tune the step size $(ss)$ and the merge factor $(mf)$ to optimize the convergence of the aggregation trees. This was done by evaluating NEMO with a certain weight and capacity and then plotting the energy consumption results for each $ss$ and $mf$ into a heat-map.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includesvg[width=1\textwidth]{./img/nemo/nemop_params_sl_capacity_100_w_weight_1.svg}
    \caption{The NEMO results with $w=1$ visualized in a heat map to determine the merge factor and stepsize.}
    \label{fig:nemo_hyper_params}
\end{figure}\\
Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_hyper_params} shows the energy consumption for the topology with a capacity of 20 and $w=1$. For this specific setup I can now tune NEMO+ by selecting the step size and merge factor with the lowest energy consumption. In this case I selected a merge factor of $0.5$ and a step size of $0.55$. These parameters could then be used to evaluate NEMO+ with it.

Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_phases}(left) shows the initial pre-processing phase of NEMO, where the nodes from the cost space are divided into distinct groups with minimal energy consumption. This leads to four groups highlighted in different colors. The network sink is also placed in this phase.
Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_phases}(middle) depicts NEMO's second phase, where it calculates the optimal placement of a virtual node within the cost space for each cluster. This virtual node serves as an operator positioned between a set of upstream nodes and the sink.\\
When the capacities required by the upstream nodes surpass the sink's available capacity, NEMO initiates an iterative process. In each iteration, it creates a new partial window aggregation operator to expand the aggregation tree by an additional level. This is shown in figure~\ref{fig:nemo_placement}. Each iteration this identifies a set of physical nodes where the operator can be replicated. This process determines the most suitable physical nodes for operator replication. NEMO then iterates over the clusters, to determine the optimal placement of the virtual node for each cluster.\\
The number of physical nodes allocated to each cluster depends on the cluster's load, as demonstrated by the orange cluster having three physical nodes, indicating a higher load compared to the green cluster with two and the red and blue clusters with only one each.

\subsection{Setting up NEMO+~\label{subsec:nemo_setup}}
NEMO+ utilizes the 2-dimensional coordinates predicted by Vivaldi, where the energy consumption between a pair of nodes corresponds to their Euclidean distance in the cost space. The iterative operation of NEMO+ involves three key phases: pre-processing, virtual operator placement, and re-assignment and replication. 

\subsubsection{Capacities and Weights~\label{subsubsec:capacities}}
In the NEMO+ simulations, different capacity distributions across nodes are tested, although the total capacity remains constant. For this experiment, the mean node capacity is set to 20, with variations in the median capacity to observe performance differences. However, the performance differences were found to be minimal, so only the results for a median capacity of 20 are presented.

NEMO+ assesses its performance under various loads by assigning different link weights ($w$) to source nodes. Three configurations are used: 
1. Uniform weight $w = 1$ for all sources.
2. Uniform weight $w = 2$ for all sources.
3. Random weights following a log-normal distribution within the range $[1,50]$ for each source.

\subsubsection{Tuning Hyper-Parameters~\label{subsubsec:hyper_params}}
To optimize NEMO+'s performance, hyper-parameters such as step size $(ss)$ and merge factor $(mf)$ are tuned for efficient convergence of the aggregation trees. This tuning involves evaluating NEMO+ under a specific weight and capacity setup, followed by plotting energy consumption results into a heat map.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Energy consumption heat map for NEMO+ with $w=1$, used to determine the optimal merge factor and step size.}
    \label{fig:nemo_hyper_params}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_hyper_params} illustrates energy consumption for a setup with a capacity of 20 and $w=1$. Based on this heat map, the optimal parameters are selected, with a merge factor of $0.5$ and a step size of $0.55$, minimizing energy consumption. These parameters are then utilized to further evaluate NEMO+'s performance.

\subsubsection{Phases of NEMO+~\label{subsubsec:nemo_phases}}
\begin{figure}[h]

    \includesvg[width=1\textwidth]{./img/nemo/nemo_phases.svg}
    \caption{NEMO+ phases: initial grouping (left), virtual operator placement (middle), and physical placement and replication (right).}
    \label{fig:nemo_phases}
\end{figure}

**Phase 1: Pre-processing**  
Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_phases}(left) depicts the pre-processing phase, where nodes from the cost space are divided into groups to minimize energy consumption, resulting in four distinct groups highlighted in different colors. The network sink is placed during this phase as well.

**Phase 2: Virtual Operator Placement**  
In this phase (Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_phases}(middle)), NEMO+ calculates the optimal placement of a virtual node, acting as an operator between upstream nodes and the sink. When upstream node capacities exceed the sink's available capacity, NEMO+ iteratively creates partial window aggregation operators to extend the aggregation tree, identifying physical nodes for operator replication. These physical nodes are stored in a lookup table, with an iterative optimization algorithm determining the virtual node placement for each cluster.

\subsubsection{Phase 3: Re-assignment and Replication~\label{subsubsec:re_assignment}}
In the final phase (Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_phases}(right)), NEMO+ determines the number and placement of physical nodes to balance the load across clusters. The allocation of physical nodes depends on the cluster's load, as shown by the orange cluster with three physical nodes, indicating a higher load, compared to the green cluster with two and the red and blue clusters with one each. This strategic distribution ensures efficient energy consumption and load management within the network.

Third Phase: Re-assignment and Replication. Finally, NEMO
determines the number and placement of replicas for each newly
created operator𝜔𝑖𝑘 in cluster 𝑘 and iteration 𝑖 to distribute the load
more evenly (line 8). To that end, it iterates through a sorted list 𝑛𝑘
of (𝜈𝑖
, 𝐶𝑎) tuples (nodes and their available capacities), allocating
capacities to each node until the total number of required capacities
is exhausted. The result is a placement list indicating the nodes
hosting the replicas and their allocated capacities. For example,
𝐶𝑟 = 8, and 𝑛𝑘 = [(3, 2), (1, 4), (5, 6), (2, 10), (4, 3)], results in 𝑝𝑘 =
[(3, 2), (1, 4), (5, 2)]. The replication factor for 𝜔𝑖𝑘 is thus 𝜌𝑖𝑘 = |𝑝𝑘
|.
The elements in 𝑛𝑘 are initially nodes in the group with available
resources above a certain threshold 𝑡. If 𝑛𝑘 does not provide enough
resources, NEMO augments it with potential cluster heads from
adjacent groups. This process is repeated until nodes with sufficient
resources for intermediate aggregation are found. In the worst case,
NEMO needs to consolidate all groups.
NEMO sorts the list 𝑛𝑘 using a distance function that penalizes
nodes with significantly lower capacities than others in their group.
This reduces the number of replicas and prevents the selection of The physical nodes hosting the newly created replicas are the
cluster heads for the recently formed aggregation level. After each
iteration, NEMO sets the cluster heads of the current level as the
new upstream nodes. Additionally, it merges clusters if cluster
heads in different groups overlap or are in close proximity. This
iterative process continues until the required capacities of the sink
do not exceed its available capacities. Each iteration reduces the
number of required capacities, guaranteeing NEMO’s convergence.

\subsection{Setting up NEMO+~\label{subsec:nemo_setup}}
NEMO+ uses the 2-dimensional coordinates from Vivaldi, where the energy consumption between node pairs corresponds to their Euclidean distance in the cost space. NEMO+ operates through three iterative phases: pre-processing, virtual operator placement, and re-assignment and replication.

\subsubsection{Capacities and Weights~\label{subsubsec:capacities}}
In NEMO+ simulations, various capacity distributions across nodes are explored, while the total capacity remains constant. For this experiment, the mean node capacity is set to 20, with variations in the median capacity assessed for performance impacts. Since these impacts are minor, only results for a median capacity of 20 are displayed.

NEMO+ evaluates performance under different loads by assigning distinct link weights ($w$) to sources. Three configurations are considered:
1. Uniform weight $w = 1$ for all sources.
2. Uniform weight $w = 2$ for all sources.
3. Random weights following a log-normal distribution within the range $[1,50]$ for each source.

\subsubsection{Tuning Hyper-Parameters~\label{subsubsec:hyper_params}}
To optimize NEMO+ performance, hyper-parameters such as step size $(ss)$ and merge factor $(mf)$ are fine-tuned for efficient convergence of aggregation trees. This involves evaluating NEMO+ under specific weights and capacities and plotting energy consumption results in a heat map.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Energy consumption heat map for NEMO+ with $w=1$, used to determine optimal merge factor and step size.}
    \label{fig:nemo_hyper_params}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_hyper_params} shows energy consumption for a setup with capacity 20 and $w=1$. The heat map guides the selection of optimal parameters, with a merge factor of $0.5$ and a step size of $0.55$, minimizing energy consumption. These parameters are used for further evaluations of NEMO+.

\subsubsection{Phases of NEMO+~\label{subsubsec:nemo_phases}}

**Phase 1: Pre-processing**  
Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_phases}(left) depicts the pre-processing phase, where nodes from the cost space are grouped to minimize energy consumption, resulting in four distinct clusters shown in different colors. The network sink is also placed during this phase.

**Phase 2: Virtual Operator Placement**  
In this phase (Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_phases}(middle)), NEMO+ calculates the optimal placement of a virtual node for each cluster. This virtual node acts as an operator positioned between upstream nodes and the sink. When the upstream nodes' capacities exceed the sink's capacity, NEMO+ initiates an iterative process, creating partial window aggregation operators to expand the aggregation tree with additional levels. During each iteration, NEMO+ identifies physical nodes for operator replication, stored in a lookup table. An iterative optimization algorithm determines the virtual node placement for each cluster, balancing the load by distributing it across multiple physical nodes.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includesvg[width=1\textwidth]{./img/nemo/nemo_phases.svg}
    \caption{NEMO+ phases: initial grouping (left), virtual operator placement (middle), and physical placement and replication (right).}
    \label{fig:nemo_phases}
\end{figure}

**Phase 3: Re-assignment and Replication**  
The final phase (Figure~\ref{fig:nemo_phases}(right)) involves determining the number and placement of replicas for each newly created operator $\omega_{ik}$ in cluster $k$ during iteration $i$, to evenly distribute the load. NEMO+ iterates through a sorted list $n_k$ of (node, available capacity) tuples, allocating capacities to nodes until the required capacities are met. For example, given a capacity requirement $C_r = 8$ and list $n_k = [(3, 2), (1, 4), (5, 6), (2, 10), (4, 3)]$, the resulting placement list would be $p_k = [(3, 2), (1, 4), (5, 2)]$, with a replication factor $\rho_{ik} = |p_k|$.

Nodes in $n_k$ initially have available resources above a certain threshold. If insufficient, NEMO+ adds potential cluster heads from adjacent groups. This iterative process continues until sufficient resources are found, potentially consolidating all groups if needed. NEMO+ sorts $n_k$ using a distance function penalizing nodes with significantly lower capacities than their group peers, reducing replica numbers and preventing suboptimal node selection.

After each iteration, the cluster heads of the current level serve as new upstream nodes. NEMO+ also merges clusters if cluster heads from different groups overlap or are in close proximity. The process iterates until the sink's capacity requirements are met, ensuring NEMO+'s convergence.

Chain performed the worst as expected since it establishes a single chain connection to the sink. This results in some nodes consuming more than 9000mW to reach the sink due to the long paths. MST performed better than Chain but still showed suboptimal results. The minimum spanning tree created by MST had some lengthy paths to the sink, leading to higher energy consumption.

Direct transmission to the sink achieved the best performance in terms of minimizing energy consumption. This is because each node transmits directly to the sink, avoiding the energy costs associated with multi-hop transmissions and intermediate relays, resulting in lower overall energy use.

w=ln(1,50) results in more nodes with lower latencies as well as more nodes with higher latencies, balancing out the overall energy consumption results to match those of the fixed weight approaches. This occurs because the log-normal weight distribution introduces more variability in the node weights, leading to uneven load distribution. Some nodes benefit from lighter loads and thus have lower latencies, while others face higher loads, resulting in higher latencies. This variability averages out, yielding performance that is comparable to the more uniform

why is there less consumption wenn less weight and more consumption when more weight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT:
ChatGPT

In the context of NEMO and the weight-based approach, the weight parameter influences the prioritization of certain nodes and their role in the network. Here's why energy consumption tends to be lower with less weight and higher with more weight:

Lower Weight (w=1 or lower weights): When a node is assigned a lower weight, it means that the node is less "important" or has a lower "load" compared to other nodes. As a result, the network does not prioritize this node as heavily for data aggregation and forwarding. Consequently, the node consumes less energy because it does not need to handle as much traffic or act as a relay point for a significant portion of the network. The communication paths can be shorter, and fewer hops may be needed to reach the sink, minimizing the energy required.

Higher Weight (w=2 or higher weights): When the weight of a node increases, it is treated as more significant, meaning it takes on a larger share of the data aggregation and forwarding responsibilities. This results in higher energy consumption because the node is tasked with handling more traffic. Additionally, higher-weighted nodes may be selected to participate more actively in routing or aggregation, requiring them to process more data or forward it across longer distances. This increases the amount of energy used.

So, the key reason for the correlation between weight and energy consumption is that higher-weighted nodes are tasked with more critical functions (such as relaying more traffic or aggregating more data), leading to increased energy consumption. Conversely, nodes with lower weights have fewer responsibilities, resulting in reduced energy demands.

NEMO with

w=2, minimally better than Leach, and nearly as good as direct_trx because with a lower weight (

w=1), nodes are assigned less importance in the aggregation process, leading to more efficient energy consumption. In this configuration, the nodes in the network are less burdened with heavy aggregation or routing responsibilities. As a result, communication paths are more optimal, requiring fewer hops and reducing energy consumption.

This is also the reason it performs similarly to direct transmission to the sink (direct_trx), where data is transmitted directly to the sink without much aggregation. Since

w=1 reduces the need for complex aggregations and long-range routing, it minimizes energy use. In contrast, higher weights (

w=2 performs less efficiently.

Moreover, compared to Leach, which involves a random clustering process, NEMO with

w=1 benefits from more balanced and optimized node responsibilities without the unpredictability of clustering, leading to slightly better performance in energy consumption.

Excluding NEMO, Chain performs early on the best due to its higher number of cluster heads $(N-2)$, leading to better load balancing and a slower increase in overloaded nodes as heterogeneity rises. In contrast, MST with $(N-1)/2$ cluster heads and LEACH with $0.1\times N$ cluster heads, experience more overloaded nodes because of their worse ability to balance the load.\\
\subsubsection{Comparison Conclusion\label{subsubsec:comparison_conclusion}}
While Leach had a good performance regarding the power consumption it performed especially bad in reducing overloaded nodes, which leads to a longer up-time of the network and therefore also increasing energy consumption. For Chain it basically is the other way around, it had horendous performance in the energy consumption comparison but performed consideratly well at reducing overloaded nodes. MST performed in both approaches mid, it had a way higher consumption than NEMO and LEACH but way lower tha Chain and also in reducing clusterheads it performed well.\\

The increase in overloaded nodes is a key factor that can impact the longevity and efficiency of a network, and Chain’s approach minimizes this rise effectively by distributing the load more evenly across the nodes.

0.1×N cluster heads, experience more overloaded nodes due to their poorer ability to balance the load. Both algorithms, especially LEACH, use fewer cluster heads, leading to higher energy consumption for certain nodes and a higher risk of node overload. These load imbalances are a critical disadvantage as they can cause nodes to fail more quickly, shortening the network's operational time.

Comparison Conclusion

While LEACH showed good power consumption results, it performed poorly in reducing overloaded nodes, which ultimately leads to a shorter up-time for the network and increased energy consumption as nodes become overburdened. This issue arises from the random clustering process in LEACH, where some clusters may become too large or unevenly distributed, causing certain nodes to work harder and consume more energy.

For Chain, the situation was reversed—it performed terribly in the energy consumption comparison but was significantly better at reducing overloaded nodes. The higher number of cluster heads in Chain leads to more evenly distributed workloads, which prevents individual nodes from overloading and extending the network’s operational lifetime. However, the downside is that the inefficiency in energy use during transmission makes it less effective overall.

MST performed in the middle of both approaches, with higher energy consumption than NEMO and LEACH, but lower than Chain. It also performed reasonably well at reducing overloaded nodes, thanks to a moderate number of cluster heads (

Ultimately, none of these approaches can compare to NEMO, which not only prevented overloaded nodes even with lower median capacities but also performed exceptionally well in reducing overall energy consumption. NEMO's ability to balance the load efficiently while minimizing energy use makes it the most robust approach for managing network resources, especially in scenarios where both energy efficiency and preventing node overload are critical to maintaining long network lifetimes.

This bar chart compares the energy consumption in milliwatts (mW) across different algorithms—direct_trx, LEACH, MST, and NEMO—while highlighting three metrics for each:

Real (mean): Actual mean energy consumption observed.
Estimated (mean): The predicted or estimated mean energy consumption based on the models.
90th percentile: The consumption value below which 90% of the nodes fall, representing the upper range of typical energy consumption.
Observations:

Direct_trx:

Real mean (599.7 mW) is close to the 90th percentile, suggesting a fairly uniform distribution of energy consumption across nodes.
Estimated mean (286.7 mW) is significantly lower than the real mean, indicating substantial underestimation in predictions. This is likely because the model fails to account for all contributing factors such as long-range transmissions for isolated nodes.

LEACH:

Real mean (591.2 mW) is close to direct_trx but slightly lower, reflecting the efficiency of hierarchical clustering in reducing energy consumption.
Estimated mean (301.8 mW) again underestimates the real value, but to a lesser extent compared to direct_trx, as LEACH's clustered communication is easier to predict accurately.
90th percentile is relatively low, showing that most nodes consume a similar amount of energy without extreme outliers.

MST:

Real mean (1948.5 mW) is much higher than the other approaches, showing its inefficiency in minimizing energy consumption. The long paths to the sink in the spanning tree likely result in high transmission costs.
Estimated mean (407.0 mW) is drastically lower, reflecting a significant misprediction. This underestimation may stem from the inability to account for the disproportionate energy burden placed on certain nodes due to the MST structure.
90th percentile is exceptionally high, further emphasizing the large energy disparities among nodes in MST.

NEMO:

Real mean (598.2 mW) is comparable to direct_trx and LEACH, showing its excellent performance in energy efficiency despite its more complex operational framework.
Estimated mean (287.5 mW) is again significantly underestimated but aligns more closely with the real mean compared to other approaches, indicating better predictability due to NEMO’s structured design.
90th percentile is low, indicating that NEMO distributes the energy load more evenly, avoiding extreme outliers in consumption.
Reasons for the Observations:

Underestimation of Energy Consumption:
For all algorithms, the estimated mean consistently underestimates the real mean, suggesting inaccuracies in the modeling or simulation assumptions. These inaccuracies may include:

Ignoring energy costs associated with retransmissions or collisions.
Oversimplified assumptions about transmission distances or environmental factors.
Overlooking node heterogeneity or variations in load distribution.

MST's High Real Mean:
The poor performance of MST stems from its topology, where certain nodes must handle disproportionately high transmission loads due to long communication paths. This leads to extreme energy consumption for some nodes, as reflected in the high 90th percentile.

NEMO’s Balanced Energy Distribution:
NEMO effectively minimizes energy consumption and balances the load across nodes, as evidenced by its relatively low real mean and 90th percentile. Its structured approach to operator placement and replication ensures no single node is overly burdened.

Direct_trx and LEACH Similarities:
Both algorithms achieve low energy consumption due to their direct or near-direct communication with the sink. However, LEACH's clustering provides a slight advantage over direct_trx in real energy consumption.

In summary, the chart demonstrates NEMO’s superiority in energy efficiency and load balancing, while also highlighting the general challenges in accurately estimating energy consumption for all algorithms.

The bar chart compares the energy consumption of four algorithms—direct transmission to the sink (direct_trx), LEACH, MST, and NEMO—using three key metrics: the real mean energy consumption, the estimated mean energy consumption, and the 90th percentile of consumption. These metrics provide insight into both the efficiency of the algorithms and the accuracy of the energy predictions.

Across all algorithms, a consistent pattern emerges: the estimated mean energy consumption underestimates the real mean. This discrepancy likely arises from oversimplified modeling assumptions, such as neglecting retransmissions, collisions, or environmental variations. Additionally, the 90th percentile values highlight the extent of energy distribution imbalances within each algorithm, with some performing significantly worse in distributing the energy load across nodes.

Direct transmission to the sink (direct_trx) demonstrates strong performance, with low real mean energy consumption that is only slightly higher than LEACH and NEMO. The 90th percentile is also relatively close to the real mean, indicating uniform energy distribution among nodes. However, the estimated mean for direct_trx is substantially lower than the real mean, suggesting that the model fails to account for long-range transmissions that disproportionately affect some nodes.

LEACH performs similarly to direct_trx in terms of real energy consumption but benefits from its clustering mechanism, which reduces the number of transmissions. Its energy distribution is balanced, as shown by the relatively low 90th percentile. However, the estimated mean again underestimates the real value, though the margin of error is smaller than for other algorithms, possibly because LEACH’s hierarchical structure is simpler to predict.

MST, in contrast, has a much higher real mean energy consumption, far exceeding that of the other algorithms. This inefficiency arises from its topology, where some nodes are required to handle long transmission paths to the sink, leading to significantly higher energy costs for these nodes. The 90th percentile value for MST is exceptionally high, reflecting the severe imbalance in energy distribution, with certain nodes disproportionately overburdened. The estimated mean for MST, however, is drastically lower than the real mean, highlighting the model’s failure to capture the inefficiencies inherent in the MST structure.

NEMO outperforms the other algorithms, achieving energy consumption nearly as low as direct_trx and LEACH while maintaining excellent load balancing, as evidenced by its low 90th percentile value. The algorithm’s structured approach to operator placement and replication ensures that no single node is excessively burdened. While the estimated mean for NEMO is also lower than the real mean, the difference is less pronounced compared to other algorithms, indicating that its predictable behavior aligns better with the model’s assumptions.

In conclusion, the chart illustrates NEMO’s superiority in energy efficiency and load balancing, demonstrating its ability to minimize energy consumption while distributing the load evenly among nodes. It also highlights the limitations of estimation models, which tend to underestimate the real energy consumption for all algorithms due to oversimplified assumptions about node behavior and network dynamics.

Network coordinate systems inherently introduce estimation errors because they rely on collected measurements that can be influenced by Triangle Inequality Violations (TIV), as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:tiv}. To assess the impact of these errors, I analyzed the performance of the tested approaches by comparing the estimated power consumption from the network coordinate system with the actual measured power consumption.

This comparison highlights the discrepancies introduced by estimation errors. The actual power consumption measurements serve as a baseline to evaluate how well the estimation aligns with real-world values. Such errors can arise due to inaccuracies in capturing the true cost relationships between nodes or the simplifications inherent in network coordinate systems. By juxtaposing the estimated and actual power consumption, the analysis provides insight into the reliability of the network coordinate system and its influence on the performance evaluation of different approaches.

The results reveal how estimation errors may lead to overly optimistic projections, particularly for approaches like MST, which exhibit significant discrepancies between estimated and actual energy consumption. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for such errors when evaluating network algorithms and emphasize the robustness of approaches like NEMO, which are less affected by estimation inaccuracies.

Figure~\ref{fig:estimation_errors} shows the real power consumption measurements and the estimated mean power consumption are really different.

For MST the real power consumption is even five times higher and for Chain, which is not contained in the figure due to to high consumption measurements, the real is eight times higher. Those two perform so bad, because they need pairwise correct power consumptions between all nodes. NEMO and Leach only need pairwise correct measurements between clusterheads and leaf nodes to clusterheads.\\
This shows that (continue)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ChatGPT:
ChatGPT

This shows that approaches requiring accurate pairwise measurements across the entire network, such as MST and Chain, are significantly more affected by estimation errors introduced by the network coordinate system. Their reliance on precise power consumption values for all possible node-to-node connections makes them particularly vulnerable to the inaccuracies caused by estimation errors. Consequently, these approaches exhibit drastically higher discrepancies between estimated and real power consumption, as evidenced by the fivefold and eightfold increases for MST and Chain, respectively.

In contrast, grouping-based approaches like NEMO and Leach demonstrate greater resilience to these errors. Since their performance depends primarily on the accuracy of measurements between cluster heads and leaf nodes, as well as among cluster heads themselves, they are less sensitive to network-wide inaccuracies. However, despite this resilience, the real power consumption for these approaches is still significantly higher than the estimated values—roughly double in the case of both NEMO and Leach.

Direct transmission (direct_trx) performs similarly poorly to NEMO in terms of estimation error impact, suggesting that the direct nature of its transmission links is also susceptible to inaccuracies in estimated values. Overall, these findings highlight the critical importance of accurate measurement collection in network coordinate systems, particularly for approaches heavily reliant on network-wide precision. It underscores the need for robust error mitigation techniques or alternative methods that minimize reliance on globally accurate pairwise estimates.

In this section, I will provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts and tools utilized throughout this thesis.

The Free-Space Path Loss equation (Section~\ref{sec:pathloss}) plays a pivotal role in understanding the energy inefficiencies that occur as transmission distances increase. This theoretical framework underpins the challenges associated with energy consumption in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), highlighting the critical importance of optimizing network configurations to mitigate these inefficiencies.

To evaluate the real-world implications of this theoretical model, experiments were conducted using the FIT/IoT-Lab platform (Section~\ref{sec:fitiot}). The FIT/IoT-Lab offers a controlled experimental environment featuring a large number of nodes distributed across multiple sites. This platform provides a diverse selection of boards, making it ideal for energy consumption studies in distributed wireless networks. For my experiments, I selected the IoT-Lab M3 board (Section~\ref{subsec:board}) due to its specific features that enabled the creation of reproducible experiments. These features were instrumental in accurately measuring and analyzing the energy consumption of distributed wireless nodes under varying network configurations.

Subsequently, the Vivaldi algorithm (Section~\ref{sec:vivaldi}) was employed to construct a two-dimensional Euclidean Network Coordinate System (NCS) based on the collected energy consumption measurements. This NCS served as the cost-space for the resource-aware optimization approach, NEMO. By leveraging the NCS, NEMO was able to optimize network configurations and reduce energy consumption effectively.

The performance of NEMO was then rigorously evaluated and benchmarked against other optimization approaches for wireless sensor networks. This comparative analysis provides valuable insights into the advantages and limitations of NEMO within the context of distributed wireless networks, emphasizing its potential as a resource-aware solution to energy inefficiencies.

\section{Free-Space Path Loss Equation\label{sec:pathloss}}

When transmitting data over long distances, the energy consumption increases significantly, making it an inefficient process. This phenomenon is accurately described by the Free-Space Path Loss (FSPL) equation~\cite{noauthor_free-space_nodate}. The FSPL equation quantifies the loss of signal strength as it travels through free space (i.e., an environment without obstacles or interference). The equation is essential for understanding how the signal power decreases over distance, and it highlights the challenges in energy consumption that arise in wireless communication systems, particularly as the transmission range extends.

The FSPL equation is expressed as:

C is a constant that incorporates the physical properties of the environment (such as the speed of light and the permeability of free space).

As the distance (

Decomposable aggregation functions (DAFs) are widely utilized in stream processing, prompting the development of NEMO (Section~\ref{sec:nemo}) to address the challenge of DAF operator placement in resource-constrained and unreliable geo-distributed environments.

The primary objective of this thesis is to enable energy-efficient operator placement for large-scale network topologies. To achieve this, I will extend the NEMO framework to optimize for minimizing energy consumption. Specifically, the goal is to adapt NEMO to operate within an energy consumption cost space and to evaluate the impact of this adaptation on its performance.

\section{Scope of the Thesis\label{sec:scope}}

\subsection{Subproblems}
To achieve the goal of this thesis I have to address several subproblems.

\subsubsection{Collect an Energy Consumption Dataset}
First of all I have to collect data for an energy consumption dataset.\\
Therefore I have to create a representative IoT environment, which I will use FIT/IoT-LAB for (section~\ref{sec:topology_setup}). After creating a representative topology I have to create a firmware for the sender (section~\ref{sec:sender}) and receiver (section~\ref{sec:receiver}) nodes, to control the experiment.\\
The energy data I gather from this experiment has to then be put into a 2-dimensional matrix, which contains the energy transmission data from every node pair in the topology (section~\ref{sec:trans_pow_mat}).\\
This matrix containing the transmission power has to be then transformed to contain the actual energy consumption in mW (section~\ref{sec:pow_cons_matrix}).\\ 

\subsubsection{Create a Cost Space}
Vivaldi can use this matrix to predict a network coordinate system (NCS) for the energy consumption data which is contained in this matrix (section~\ref{subsec:vivaldi_eval}). There I will also analyzie potential triangle inequality violations (section~\ref{subsubsec:tiv_eval}). This NCS can then be used as NEMOs cost space.

\subsubsection{Collecting an Energy Consumption Dataset}
The first step involves gathering data to construct an energy consumption dataset. To accomplish this, I will create a representative IoT environment using the FIT/IoT-LAB platform (Section~\ref{sec:topology_setup}). Within this environment, I will design and implement firmware for both sender (Section~\ref{sec:sender}) and receiver (Section~\ref{sec:receiver}) nodes to control and execute the experiment.

The energy data collected from this experiment will be organized into a two-dimensional matrix, capturing the transmission energy data between all node pairs in the topology (Section~\ref{sec:trans_pow_mat}). This transmission power matrix will then be transformed into a representation of the actual energy consumption in milliwatts (Section~\ref{sec:pow_cons_matrix}).

\subsubsection{Creating a Cost Space}
The Vivaldi algorithm will be utilized to generate a network coordinate system (NCS) based on the energy consumption data in the matrix (Section~\ref{subsec:vivaldi_eval}). During this process, I will also analyze potential triangle inequality violations (Section~\ref{subsubsec:tiv_eval}). The resulting NCS will then serve as the cost space for NEMO.

\subsubsection{Evaluating the Results of NEMO}
Finally, I will evaluate the performance of NEMO using energy consumption as the cost space. This evaluation will provide insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed energy-efficient operator placement strategy.

\subsection{Out of Scope}
Out of scope for this Thesis is to conduct energy consumption measurement on other IoT testbeds than the FIT/IoT-Lab testbed. Testing other energy related metrics other than power, such as Volt and Ampere, as a cost space for NEMO.

\subsection{Out of Scope}
This thesis does not include energy consumption measurements conducted on IoT testbeds other than the FIT/IoT-Lab. Additionally, it excludes exploring energy-related metrics other than power, such as voltage or current (e.g., Volt and Ampere), as potential cost spaces for NEMO. Furthermore, the evaluation and comparison of results will be limited to the same approaches against which NEMO with latency as a cost space was compared: LEACH, Chain, and MST.

A reason for the bad predictions could be corrupted data in the gateway matrix, due to a bad choice for the gateway algorithm which led to a high TIVs or non constant environmental factores which obstructed the wireless signal during the sending phase. This could happen when someone else uses neighboring or close nodes for their experiment which weakened our signal. So during the experiment it could happen that for two nodes A and B, that A reached B with a transmission power of -10dBm and B reached A with a transmission power of +3dBm. This makes it very tough for Vivaldi.

One potential reason for the poor predictions could be corrupted data in the gateway matrix, caused by an unsuitable gateway algorithm that resulted in high triangle inequality violations (TIVs) or non-constant environmental factors obstructing the wireless signal during the transmission phase. For instance, interference could arise from neighboring experiments using nearby nodes, which might weaken the signal. Consequently, during the experiment, it is possible for two nodes, A and B, to experience inconsistent transmission power levels—for example, A reaching B with a transmission power of -10 dBm while B reaches A with +3 dBm. Such discrepancies significantly challenge the Vivaldi algorithm's ability to produce accurate predictions.

In summary, the results highlight the overall poor performance and therefore the high impact of estimation errors. These estimation errors most likely arise from the bad predictions by Vivaldi or come from corrupted data in the data gathering phase, which is caused by non constant environmental factors.

In summary, the results underscore the overall poor performance and the substantial impact of estimation errors. These errors are most likely attributable to inaccurate predictions by the Vivaldi algorithm or to corrupted data during the data collection phase, which may have been caused by non-constant environmental factors.

But also non-constant environmental factors obstructing the wireless signal during the transmission phase distort the data. For instance, interference could arise from neighboring experiments using nearby nodes, office workers using their electronical devices, moving objects in the building, or nodes crashing during an experiment, which all could weaken the signal or change the result drasticly.

Additionally, non-constant environmental factors obstructing the wireless signal during the transmission phase further distort the data. For example, interference could result from neighboring experiments utilizing nearby nodes, office workers using electronic devices, moving objects within the building, or nodes crashing during the experiment. Any of these factors could significantly weaken the signal or drastically alter the results.

These problems could be reduced in future work by contacting the FIT/IoT-LAB to fully claim a site so that no one else can use it and conduct the experiments at night times, when there are no office workers. In future work also other boards with different radio antennas should be used, in which the transmitting consumption actually exceeds the receiving consumption to highlight the exponential increase in energy consumption further, this would then also enable to test different gateway algorithms.

These issues could be mitigated in future work by coordinating with the FIT/IoT-LAB to fully reserve a site, ensuring that no other users interfere with the experiments. Additionally, conducting experiments during nighttime, when there is minimal activity from office workers, would help reduce environmental disruptions. Future research could also explore the use of different boards with varying radio antennas, particularly those where transmission energy consumption significantly exceeds reception energy consumption. This would better emphasize the exponential increase in energy consumption and enable testing of alternative gateway algorithms.

In this thesis I researched if extending NEMO by an energy consumption cost space, enables energy efficient DAF operator placement for resource-constraint and large geo-distributed topologies. Therefore I gathered a representative energy consumption measurement dataset from the FIT/IoT-LAB, created a 2-dimensional energy consumption cost space with Vivaldi and used this to enable NEMO to optimize on minimizing the energy consumption.\\
The simulations showed that NEMO performed really well in reducing the overall communication costs, and therefore minimizes the energy consumption, and also prevented overloaded nodes along the way.\\
But the problem that remains are the bad predictions by Vivaldi and the very high estimation errors, which are most likely caused by non-constant environmental factors.\\

In this thesis, I investigated whether extending NEMO with an energy consumption cost space enables energy-efficient DAF operator placement for resource-constrained, large-scale, and geo-distributed topologies. To this end, I collected a representative energy consumption dataset using the FIT/IoT-LAB, constructed a two-dimensional energy consumption cost space using the Vivaldi algorithm, and adapted NEMO to optimize for minimizing energy consumption.

The simulation results demonstrated that NEMO excelled in significantly reducing overall communication costs, thereby minimizing energy consumption, while simultaneously preventing node overload. These findings highlight NEMO's potential as a robust approach for optimizing energy efficiency in distributed systems.

However, the study also revealed persistent challenges, particularly the poor predictions from Vivaldi and the high estimation errors, likely stemming from non-constant environmental factors. These inaccuracies underscore the need for further refinement in data collection and cost space prediction.

Future work could address these challenges by collaborating with FIT/IoT-LAB administrators to fully reserve experimental sites, ensuring interference-free conditions. Conducting experiments during nighttime, when environmental disruptions such as office activity are minimal, would also enhance data reliability. Additionally, future research could incorporate alternative hardware, such as boards with different radio antenna configurations where transmission energy consumption significantly exceeds reception energy consumption. This would emphasize the exponential relationship between transmission distance and energy use, while also enabling experimentation with different gateway algorithms.

In conclusion, while this thesis successfully demonstrated the viability of extending NEMO to optimize energy-efficient operator placement, it also laid the groundwork for further exploration and refinement in real-world experimental setups and optimization algorithms.
