what does this function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The function get_lognorm_hist generates a histogram from a random sample of values drawn from a log-normal distribution. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Set Parameters for Log-Normal Distribution:

The mode (mode) is set to 1, and the standard deviation (stddev) is set to 50.
These parameters are used to calculate the shape parameter (sigma) and scale parameter (scale) for the log-normal distribution using the helper function util.lognorm_params.

Print Parameters:

It prints the calculated sigma (the shape parameter) and scale (the scale parameter) of the log-normal distribution.

Generate Random Sample:

The lognorm.rvs function is used to draw 10,000 random samples from a log-normal distribution with the given sigma, loc=0, and scale.
The resulting samples are converted to integers using .astype(int).

Create a Histogram:

np.histogram computes the histogram of the generated sample. It:
Uses 100 equally spaced bins in the range of 0 to 100.
Normalizes the histogram such that the area under the curve sums to 1 (density=True).
The histogram values (H) and the edges of the bins (bins) are returned.
Return Value:
H: An array containing the normalized counts for each histogram bin.
bins: An array of bin edges corresponding to the histogram.
Use Case:

This function is useful when:

Simulating or visualizing a log-normal distribution.
Exploring how a given mode and standard deviation translate into a log-normal distribution's shape.
Working on tasks that involve statistical modeling or probabilistic analysis with log-normal data.
Dependencies:

For this function to work, the following are required:

util.lognorm_params: A utility function that calculates sigma and scale based on a mode and standard deviation.
lognorm from scipy.stats.
numpy (imported as np).

To save the dist array as a CSV file instead of a text file, you can use the numpy.savetxt function but specify a .csv extension for the output file. Additionally, you can include a delimiter (, for CSV) to ensure the file follows the CSV format.

Here's the updated code:

import numpy as np

# Read the nodes file
with open("nodes.txt", "r") as file:
    nodes_file = file.read()

# Initialize the array
arr = np.zeros((50, 3))

# Process the lines and fill the array
for line in nodes_file.splitlines():
    parts = line.split()
    node = int(parts[0].split("-")[1].split(".")[0])
    x = float(parts[6])
    y = float(parts[7])
    z = float(parts[8])

    arr[node-1][0] = x
    arr[node-1][1] = y
    arr[node-1][2] = z

# Compute the distance matrix
dist = np.zeros((50, 50))
for i in range(50):
    for j in range(50):
        t1 = arr[i]
        t2 = arr[j]
        minus = t1 - t2
        square = minus ** 2
        s = sum(square)
        dist[i][j] = math.sqrt(s)

# Save the distance matrix as a CSV file
np.savetxt("dist_array.csv", dist, fmt="%.2f", delimiter=",")

Key Changes:
Changed the file name to dist_array.csv.
Added delimiter="," to ensure the values are separated by commas in the CSV file.

This will create a properly formatted CSV file that can be opened in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or any text editor supporting CSV.

If you want to add a header or a specific line to the CSV file (e.g., a header row or additional metadata), you can do this by using Python's file-handling capabilities combined with numpy.savetxt.

Here's how you can add a line (e.g., a header) before the array data in the CSV file:

python

import math
import numpy as np

# Read the nodes file
with open("nodes.txt", "r") as file:
    nodes_file = file.read()

# Initialize the array
arr = np.zeros((50, 3))

# Process the lines and fill the array
for line in nodes_file.splitlines():
    parts = line.split()
    node = int(parts
