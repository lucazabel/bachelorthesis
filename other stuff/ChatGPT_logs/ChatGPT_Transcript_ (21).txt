MCU stands for Microcontroller Unit, which is a small computer on a single integrated circuit. An MCU typically includes a processor core (e.g., Cortex-M), memory (RAM and Flash), and peripherals (e.g., timers, communication interfaces). MCUs are designed for specific control applications in embedded systems like IoT devices.

SoC stands for System on Chip, which integrates a complete computing system onto a single chip. An SoC can include a processor (or multiple processors), memory, digital and analog peripherals, and sometimes even wireless communication capabilities. SoCs are more complex than MCUs and are used in high-performance applications like smartphones, advanced IoT devices, and edge computing.

In the context of IoT devices, Radio refers to the hardware and technology used to enable wireless communication between devices. Radios use electromagnetic waves to transmit and receive data. The type of radio on a device determines which wireless communication protocols and frequency bands it can support.

In the table you provided, the columns under "Radio" refer to specific wireless technologies or frequency bands:

802.15.4:

A standard for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs).
Used by protocols like Zigbee, Thread, and 6LoWPAN.
Operates typically in the 2.4 GHz band but can also use sub-GHz bands.

Sub-GHz:

Refers to frequencies below 1 GHz (e.g., 868 MHz in Europe or 915 MHz in North America).
Commonly used for low-power, long-range communication protocols like LoRa, Sigfox, or proprietary systems.

BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy):

A low-power version of Bluetooth designed for IoT devices.
Operates in the 2.4 GHz band.
Ideal for short-range, low-energy communication like wearables or smart home devices.

LoRa:

Short for Long Range.
A low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN) technology for IoT.
Operates in unlicensed sub-GHz bands (e.g., 868/915 MHz).
Known for its long-range and energy-efficient communication.

UWB (Ultra-Wideband):

A short-range wireless communication technology.
Uses a wide frequency spectrum to transmit data.

The AT86RF231 radio chip offers several key features that provide distinct advantages for my experiments. One of the challenges in conducting experiments within the FiT/IoT-Lab environment is the shared space within the building. The building is not only designed for the microchips but is also used by other researchers who are conducting their own experiments. This can lead to potential interference, as multiple experiments may be running simultaneously in close proximity.

However, one of the standout features of the AT86RF231 chip is its high receiver sensitivity of -101 dBm. This sensitivity is particularly beneficial in ensuring that my measurements remain accurate and consistent, even in an environment with multiple active experiments. The chip's high sensitivity ensures that it can reliably detect and communicate even weak signals, mitigating the potential impact of interference from other experiments in the building.

Additionally, the AT86RF231 radio chip is equipped with the capability to measure Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which allows for real-time monitoring of the strength of incoming signals. This is crucial for assessing the quality of communication between nodes and for adjusting the system's parameters to maintain optimal performance.

Moreover, the chip offers flexibility in controlling the transmission power of the antenna. The transmission power can be adjusted across 15 different levels, ranging from a minimum of -17 dBm to a maximum of +3 dBm. This ability to modify the transmission power allows for fine-tuning the radio's range and energy consumption, which is particularly useful for optimizing the experimental setup and ensuring that power usage is minimized without sacrificing communication reliability.

These features of the AT86RF231 radio chip play a critical role in maintaining the integrity and consistency of my measurements in the FiT/IoT-Lab environment, even when other experiments are being conducted in parallel.

The AT86RF231 radio chip offers several key features that provide distinct advantages for my experiments.

A significant challenge when conducting experiments in the FiT/IoT-Lab environment is the shared nature of its resources. With multiple researchers conducting their own experiments simultaneously, interference between experiments is inevitable. This can lead to overlapping signals and potential degradation of data quality if not managed carefully.

One of the standout features of the AT86RF231 radio chip is its high receiver sensitivity of -101 decibel-milliwatts (dBm). This level of sensitivity is particularly beneficial in maintaining the accuracy and consistency of measurements across multiple experimental runs. Even in the presence of signal interference, the chip’s high sensitivity allows it to reliably detect and receive weakened signals. This capability ensured that my measurements were minimally impacted by the activities of other researchers.

To further reduce the impact of interference, I strategically conducted my experiments at night when fewer experiments were active in the lab. Additionally, I selected nodes located in Sector J of the building, as this sector is somewhat isolated from other nodes, providing a more controlled environment for my measurements.

Another key feature of the AT86RF231 radio chip is its ability to measure the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). This functionality allowed me to monitor the quality and usability of the signals during the experiment, ensuring that any interference or attenuation could be accounted for in the analysis.

A particularly crucial aspect of the chip for this experiment was its adjustable transmission power. The antenna’s transmission power can be finely tuned across 15 different levels, ranging from a minimum of -17 dBm to a maximum of +3 dBm. This flexibility enabled me to optimize the transmission power for specific experimental conditions, balancing the trade-offs between signal range and power consumption.

These features collectively ensured that the AT86RF231 chip provided a reliable and adaptable foundation for my experiments, even within the challenging shared environment of the FiT/IoT-Lab.

To control the IoT-Lab M3 board I utilized the Openlap operating system, which offers a comprehensive set of libraries and allows me to compile code written in C, to a  file with 
 an executable and linkable format (.elf), which is required by the board.\\
Using these resources, I developed an algorithm for the sender, which I refer as the sender firmware.
This sender firmware first of all enters a phase locked loop (PLL), to synchronize the internal oscillator to a reference signal to stabilize the frequenzy. This ensures that that the radio transmitter operates at the correct frequency and phase, to avoid errors in communication. 
Then the radio chip enters the idle state, as only in the idle state the transmission power can be changed. The algorithm then proceeds to broadcast 30 packages. Than it will enter the idle state again, switches to the next transmission power until all transmission powers are covered.\\
In the receiver algorithm at first the receiver sensitivity is set to -101 dBm and than the prebuild function mac_csma_data_reiced is called in the background, which always triggers when a package is received. After a packages is received, it logs the informations in following format:
timestamp; receiver; sender;length of the package; RSSI; transmission power; Data

To control the IoT-Lab M3 board, I used the Openlap operating system, which provides a comprehensive set of libraries and enables me to compile code written in C into an executable and linkable format (.elf), which is required by the board.

Using these resources, I developed an algorithm for the sender, referred to as the sender firmware. This firmware starts by entering a phase-locked loop (PLL) to synchronize the internal oscillator with a reference signal, stabilizing the frequency. This ensures that the radio transmitter operates at the correct frequency and phase, avoiding communication errors.

Next, the radio chip enters the idle state, as transmission power can only be modified in this state. The algorithm then broadcasts 30 packets before returning to the idle state. Afterward, it switches to the next transmission power level, continuing until all the power levels have been tested.

In the receiver algorithm, the receiver sensitivity is initially set to -101 dBm, and then a pre-built function, mac_csma_data_received, is called in the background. This function is triggered whenever a packet is received. Upon receiving a packet, the algorithm logs the following information in a specific format:

Timestamp
Receiver
Sender
Length of the packet
RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)
Transmission power
Data
