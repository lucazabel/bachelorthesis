Thesis Rewrite:
The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly heightened the relevance of stream processing. A prominent trend in this domain involves the offloading of decomposable aggregation function (DAF) computations from centralized cloud infrastructures to geo-distributed edge devices. However, these edge devices often operate under stringent energy constraints.

To address this limitation, the resource-aware optimization framework NEMO determines both the replication factor and the optimal placement of DAF operators across resource-constrained, geo-distributed topologies. NEMO minimizes latency effectively while preventing node overload, making it particularly well-suited for such environments.

Nevertheless, to further enhance the operational longevity of edge devices—and, by extension, the overall network availability—NEMO can be adapted to prioritize the minimization of energy consumption instead of latency. This thesis tackles this challenge by collecting representative energy consumption data, constructing an energy consumption cost model, and integrating this cost model into NEMO. These enhancements enable NEMO to optimize for reduced energy consumption while preserving its existing advantages.

The findings of this thesis demonstrate that energy-optimized NEMO significantly reduces energy consumption while continuing to prevent node overloads. It consistently outperforms wireless communication network approaches such as LEACH, MST, and Chain. Additionally, this study highlights the complexities and challenges inherent in collecting accurate and reliable energy consumption data for node-to-node communication in distributed topologies.

Key Changes Highlighted:

Improved sentence structure for formality and precision:

"The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly increased the importance of stream processing" →
"The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly heightened the relevance of stream processing."
This change uses more formal phrasing (e.g., "proliferation" and "heightened") and eliminates the informal "importance."

Consistency in terminology and phrasing:

"geo-distributed edge devices" → "geo-distributed topologies" in some cases to avoid redundancy.
"Making it well-suited for such environments" → "making it particularly well-suited for such environments" for specificity.

Clarification and precision in technical descriptions:

"energy consumption cost space" → "energy consumption cost model" to convey a more technical and formal representation.
"Maintaining its other upsides" → "while preserving its existing advantages" for clarity and improved fluency.

Enhancing transitions and flow:

Introduced logical transitions (e.g., "nevertheless," "by extension") to improve coherence between paragraphs.
Streamlined sentences for readability without altering meaning.

Emphasis on challenges and contributions:

"Challenges associated with collecting accurate and reliable energy consumption data" →
"complexities and challenges inherent in collecting accurate and reliable energy consumption data" to emphasize the difficulty.
