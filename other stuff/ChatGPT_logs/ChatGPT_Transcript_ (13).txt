Decomposable aggregation functions are mathematical or computational operations that can be broken down into smaller, independent sub-calculations, which can then be combined to produce the final result. These functions are particularly useful in distributed systems, parallel processing, and big data frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, and Flink.

Characteristics of Decomposable Aggregation Functions
Sub-Result Independence: The function can process subsets of data independently.
Combinable Sub-Results: The partial results can be aggregated (combined) to obtain the same final result as processing the entire dataset in one go.
Associative Property: The order in which the data is processed does not matter, allowing efficient parallel computation.

In stream processing, decomposable aggregation functions are operations that can be split into smaller computations on individual data chunks (or windows) and then combined to get the final result. These functions enable efficient parallel and distributed processing in real-time systems.

Examples:
SUM: Sum partial results from chunks.
COUNT: Count items in each chunk, then sum the counts.
MIN/MAX: Find min/max in chunks, then combine.
AVERAGE: Combine partial sums and counts to compute the overall average.

They are essential for scalability in systems like Apache Flink or Spark Streaming.
