Du:
x = np.linspace(0, window_size, frames_arr.shape[1])

    plt.title("First 4 successive frames for (normalized between -1 and 1)")
    plt.xlabel("Time in Seconds")

    for i in range(4):
        plt.subplot(4, 1, i + 1)  # 4 rows, 1 column
        plt.plot(x, frames_arr[i, :])

i dont want it to show the axis from the original plot

If you want to hide the axes for the individual subplots in your code, you can use plt.axis('off') or plt.gca().axis('off') within the loop to remove the axis from each subplot. Here's how you can modify your code:

python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, window_size, frames_arr.shape[1])

plt.title("First 4 successive frames for (normalized between -1 and 1)")
plt.xlabel("Time in Seconds")

for i in range(4):
    plt.subplot(4, 1, i + 1)  # 4 rows, 1 column
    plt.plot(x, frames_arr[i, :])
    plt.axis('off')  # Hide the axis for each subplot

plt.tight_layout()  # Adjust layout to avoid overlap
plt.show()

Explanation:
plt.axis('off') will remove both the axis ticks and labels from the plot.
plt.tight_layout() helps to ensure that the subplots donâ€™t overlap and are properly spaced.

This should give you the desired effect where the axis is hidden for each of the four subplots.
