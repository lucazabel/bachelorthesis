This shall be the abstract of my Thesis. It should not be longer than 250 words and should use propper english according to the thesis level. Refine and rewrite it

With the rapid growth of the Internet of Thing (IoT) stream processing becomes even more significant. In stream processing decomposable aggregation functions (DAF) are typical and a recent trend is to offload these from the cloud to geo-distributed edge devices. The resource-aware optimization approach NEMO can determine the replication factor and position of DAF operators in resource-constrained geo-distributed topologies.\\
And while NEMO achieves great results on minimizing the latency and preventing overloaded nodes, the minimization of the energy consumption is neglected. But edge devices are typically very limited on energy resources. This thesis addresses this problem by collecting representative energy consumption data, creating a energy consumption cost space and extending NEMO by this energy consumption cost space so it is able to minimize the energy.\\
The results of this thesis highlight that NEMO is indeed able to optimize on minimizing the energy consumption and outperforms other approaches for wireless signal networks, while fully preventing overloaded nodes. But the results of thesis also highlights the problems of gathering reliable energy consumption data between a pair of nodes in a distributed topology.

Here’s a refined and concise version of your abstract, adhering to proper academic English and keeping within the word limit:

The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has amplified the importance of stream processing, particularly in managing decomposable aggregation functions (DAFs). A recent trend involves offloading DAF computations from the cloud to geo-distributed edge devices. NEMO, a resource-aware optimization approach, determines the replication factor and placement of DAF operators in resource-constrained, geo-distributed topologies to minimize latency and avoid node overload.

However, NEMO overlooks energy consumption—a critical limitation for energy-constrained edge devices. This thesis addresses this gap by collecting representative energy consumption data, constructing an energy consumption cost space, and extending NEMO to incorporate energy optimization.

The results demonstrate that the extended NEMO effectively minimizes energy consumption, outperforming alternative approaches in wireless signal networks while maintaining overload prevention. However, the study also underscores the challenges of obtaining reliable energy consumption data between nodes in distributed topologies.

You're right! Let me expand and refine it further to provide more detail while staying under 250 words:

The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made stream processing increasingly critical, particularly for managing decomposable aggregation functions (DAFs). A recent trend involves offloading DAF computations from centralized cloud environments to geo-distributed edge devices. NEMO, a resource-aware optimization approach, addresses this need by determining the replication factor and optimal placement of DAF operators in resource-constrained, geo-distributed topologies, minimizing latency and preventing node overload.

However, NEMO does not consider energy consumption, a key limitation for energy-constrained edge devices, which are commonly deployed in IoT scenarios. This thesis addresses this issue by collecting representative energy consumption data, developing an energy consumption cost space, and extending NEMO with energy-awareness capabilities. The proposed extension enables NEMO to optimize energy consumption alongside latency and node utilization.

The findings of this thesis demonstrate that the energy-optimized NEMO significantly reduces energy consumption while continuing to prevent node overload, outperforming alternative approaches in wireless signal networks. Additionally, this work highlights the challenges associated with collecting accurate and reliable energy consumption data for node-to-node communication in distributed topologies. These challenges underscore the importance of precise energy modeling in achieving robust optimization for IoT applications.

By extending NEMO to account for energy efficiency, this thesis contributes to more sustainable and effective edge computing solutions, addressing a critical limitation in existing optimization approaches.

Here's an updated version of your abstract, incorporating the additional details you provided and ensuring proper academic tone and flow:

The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made stream processing increasingly vital, particularly for managing decomposable aggregation functions (DAFs). A recent trend involves offloading DAF computations from centralized cloud environments to geo-distributed edge devices. NEMO, a resource-aware optimization approach, addresses this need by determining the replication factor and optimal placement of DAF operators in resource-constrained, geo-distributed topologies. While NEMO effectively minimizes latency and prevents node overload, it does not directly consider energy consumption, a critical factor for energy-limited edge devices commonly deployed in stream-processing environments.

This thesis addresses this limitation by collecting representative energy consumption data, constructing an energy consumption cost space, and extending NEMO to incorporate energy-aware optimization. By integrating energy consumption as an optimization metric, the extended NEMO minimizes energy usage while preserving its advantages of latency reduction and overload prevention.

The results demonstrate that the energy-optimized NEMO achieves significant reductions in energy consumption, outperforming alternative approaches in wireless signal networks. Furthermore, this work highlights the challenges of collecting reliable energy consumption data between nodes in distributed topologies, emphasizing the importance of accurate energy modeling for effective optimization.
