# Sample list of lists with float values
data = [
    [0.9, 0.8, 0.85],
    [0.5, 0.6, 0.7],
    [0.95, 0.9, 1.0],
    [0.7, 0.75, 0.8]
]

# Filter sublists where the average is 0.8 or higher
filtered_data = [sublist for sublist in data if sum(sublist) / len(sublist) >= 0.8]

print(filtered_data)

Explanation:
sum(sublist) / len(sublist): Calculates the average of the sublist.
if sum(sublist) / len(sublist) >= 0.8: Keeps only sublists with an average of 0.8 or higher.
List comprehension: Creates a new list with the filtered sublists.

This will remove sublists that do not meet the condition. Let me know if you need further assistance!
