A recent trend in stream processing is offloading the computation
of decomposable aggregation functions (DAF) from cloud nodes to
geo-distributed fog/edge devices to decrease latency and improve
energy efficiency. However, deploying DAFs on low-end devices
is challenging due to their volatility and limited resources. Additionally, in geo-distributed fog/edge environments, creating new
operator instances on demand and replicating operators ubiquitously is restricted, posing challenges for achieving load balancing
without overloading devices. Existing work predominantly focuses
on cloud environments, overlooking DAF operator placement in
resource-constrained and unreliable geo-distributed settings.
This paper presents NEMO, a resource-aware optimization approach that determines the replication factor and placement of
DAF operators in resource-constrained geo-distributed topologies.
Leveraging Euclidean embeddings of network topologies and a set
of heuristics, NEMO scales to millions of nodes and handles topological changes through adaptive re-placement and re-replication
decisions. Compared to existing solutions, NEMO achieves up to
6× lower latency and up to 15× reduction in communication cost,
while preventing overloaded nodes. Moreover, NEMO re-optimizes
placements in constant time, regardless of the topology size. As a
result, it lays the foundation to efficiently process continuous data
streams on large, heterogeneous, and geo-distributed topologies.

In this context, the replication factor refers to the number of instances or copies of a Decomposable Aggregation Function (DAF) operator that are created and deployed across the geo-distributed fog/edge environment.

By replicating the DAF operators, the system aims to:

Improve Fault Tolerance: If one device becomes unavailable or unreliable, another instance of the operator can continue processing without interruption.
Enhance Load Balancing: Spreading the workload across multiple replicated instances can prevent any single device from being overwhelmed.
Reduce Latency and Communication Costs: By strategically placing replicated instances closer to the data sources or points of interest, the time and cost of transmitting data over the network can be minimized.

However, determining the appropriate replication factor is a trade-off:

A higher replication factor increases redundancy and resilience but consumes more resources (e.g., memory, processing power) on resource-constrained edge devices.
A lower replication factor minimizes resource usage but risks overloading individual devices or creating bottlenecks if some nodes fail.

In the case of NEMO, the system dynamically optimizes the replication factor based on the constraints and characteristics of the geo-distributed environment, ensuring efficient use of resources while maintaining performance and reliability.
