I now did 15 plots which 30 measurements each.
Now i want to make 1 plot where the x axis is the 15 powerlevels (-17, -12, -10, -7, -5 , -4, -3, -2, -1, 0.7, 1.3, 1.8, 2.3, 2.8, 3) and the y axis in the power in watts.

To create a single plot with 15 power levels on the x-axis and corresponding power measurements in watts on the y-axis, you will need to aggregate your data for each power level. Here's how you can approach the task:

Steps to achieve this:

Data Preparation:

You should have 15 groups of 30 measurements, each corresponding to a specific power level.
The power levels are given as: [-17, -12, -10, -7, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0.7, 1.3, 1.8, 2.3, 2.8, 3].
For each power level, you'll need to extract the corresponding 30 measurements.

Plotting:

You will use sns.boxplot() for the main boxplot and sns.swarmplot() to show individual measurements for each power level.
Make sure to adjust the x-axis to represent the power levels.
Example Code:

Assuming filtered_list holds your data and that the measurements for each power level are already correctly indexed, hereâ€™s how you can create the plot:

python
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Define the 15 power levels
power_levels = [-17, -12, -10, -7, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0.7, 1.3, 1.8, 2.3, 2.8, 3]

# Assuming filtered_list is already defined and contains your measurements
# You need to split this list into 15 groups, one for each power level

# Create a list to store each group of measurements (30 values per group)
data = []
for i in range(15):
    data.append(filtered_list[i*30:(i+1)*30])

# Set the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))

# Create the boxplot with a swarm plot on top
sns.boxplot(data=data, whis=[0, 100], width=.6, showcaps=True)
sns.swarmplot(data=data, size=4, color="0", alpha=0.8)

# Customize the plot
plt.title("Power Levels vs. Power in Watts")
plt.xlabel("Power Levels (dBm)")
plt.ylabel("Power in Watts")
plt.xticks(ticks=range(15), labels=power_levels)

# Save the plot as a .png file
plt.savefig("plots/power_levels_vs_watts.png")

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Explanation of the Code:

Data Aggregation:
The data list is populated by slicing filtered_list into chunks of 30 measurements, one for each power level.

Plotting:

sns.boxplot(data=data): Creates the boxplot for each power level.
sns.swarmplot(data=data): Overlays individual measurements as dots on the boxplot.

Customizations:

xticks: The x-axis is set to show the 15 power levels.
The labels for the x-axis are assigned from the power_levels list.

Saving and Showing the Plot:
The plot is saved as "power_levels_vs_watts.png" in the "plots" folder, and then displayed with plt.show().

This will give you a plot where each power level on the x-axis corresponds to a boxplot and swarm plot showing the power measurements in watts for that level.

Thanks for the clarification! If data is a list of lists, where each sublist contains measurements corresponding to a specific power level, you can still follow the same general approach, but you'll need to ensure the structure of data is correctly handled for the seaborn plot functions.

Let's assume that your data is structured as follows:

python
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
data = [
    [measurements for power level -17],
    [measurements for power level -12],
    [measurements for power level -10],
    ...
    [measurements for power level 3]
]


Each element of data corresponds to the 30 measurements for a specific power level. The following steps will show how to create the plot:

Updated Code:
python
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Define the 15 power levels
power_levels = [-17, -12, -10, -7, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0.7, 1.3, 1.8, 2.3, 2.8, 3]

# Assuming `data` is a list of 15 sublists, each with 30 measurements
# Example: data = [[value1, value2, ..., value30], ..., [value1, value2, ..., value30]]

# Set the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))

# Create the boxplot with a swarm plot on top
sns.boxplot(data=data, whis=[0, 100], width=.6, showcaps=True)
sns.swarmplot(data=data, size=4, color="0", alpha=0.8)

# Customize the plot
plt.title("Power Levels vs. Power in Watts")
plt.xlabel("Power Levels (dBm)")
plt.ylabel("Power in Watts")
plt.xticks(ticks=range(15), labels=power_levels)

# Save the plot as a .png file
plt.savefig("plots/power_levels_vs_watts.png")

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Breakdown of the Code:

Data Structure:

data is a list of 15 sublists, with each sublist containing 30 measurements.
This structure works directly with seaborn's boxplot and swarmplot, as both can take a list of lists (or a 2D array) where each list corresponds to a separate category.

Plotting:

sns.boxplot(data=data): This generates a boxplot for each of the 15 power levels.
sns.swarmplot(data=data): This overlays a swarm plot of the individual measurements on top of the boxplot.

Customizations:

xticks: The x-axis ticks are set to the power levels [-17, -12, -10, ..., 3].
The labels for the x-axis correspond to the power levels, and the plot title and axis labels are also customized.

Saving and Displaying:
The plot is saved as "power_levels_vs_watts.png" and displayed.

Expected Result:

This code will create a plot where:

The x-axis represents the 15 power levels (dBm).
The y-axis represents the power values (in watts).
Each power level will have a corresponding boxplot, and individual measurements will be shown as dots on top of the boxplots.

Let me know if you need further adjustments!
