The error you're encountering indicates that you're trying to call the flatten method on a Python list object. However, lists in Python do not have a flatten method, which is why you're seeing an AttributeError.

Steps to Resolve:

Identify the Data Type: Ensure that the object merged_arr[col, i][0] is indeed a NumPy array or any other object that has the flatten method. You can use print(type(merged_arr[col, i][0])) to check the type.

Convert to NumPy Array: If merged_arr[col, i][0] is a list and you need to flatten it, you should convert it to a NumPy array first. Hereâ€™s how you can modify your code:

python
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
import numpy as np

flat = np.array(merged_arr[col, i][0]).flatten()
if not np.isnan(flat).any():
    # Your code here


Handle Non-Array Cases: If you sometimes expect a list and other times a NumPy array, you can add a check to convert only when necessary:

python
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
import numpy as np

element = merged_arr[col, i][0]
if isinstance(element, list):
    element = np.array(element)
flat = element.flatten()
if not np.isnan(flat).any():
    # Your code here


By converting the list to a NumPy array before flattening, you can avoid the AttributeError and ensure that the flatten operation is properly applied.
