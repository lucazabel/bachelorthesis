	abstract = {A recent trend in stream processing is offloading the computation of decomposable aggregation functions ({DAF}) from cloud nodes to geo-distributed fog/edge devices to decrease latency and improve energy efficiency. However, deploying {DAFs} on low-end devices is challenging due to their volatility and limited resources. Additionally, in geo-distributed fog/edge environments, creating new operator instances on demand and replicating operators ubiquitously is restricted, posing challenges for achieving load balancing without overloading devices. Existing work predominantly focuses on cloud environments, overlooking {DAF} operator placement in resource-constrained and unreliable geo-distributed settings.
            This paper presents {NEMO}, a resource-aware optimization approach that determines the replication factor and placement of {DAF} operators in resource-constrained geo-distributed topologies. Leveraging Euclidean embeddings of network topologies and a set of heuristics, {NEMO} scales to millions of nodes and handles topo-logical changes through adaptive re-placement and re-replication decisions. Compared to existing solutions, {NEMO} achieves up to 6× lower latency and up to 15× reduction in communication cost, while preventing overloaded nodes. Moreover, {NEMO} re-optimizes placements in constant time, regardless of the topology size. As a result, it lays the foundation to efficiently process continuous data streams on large, heterogeneous, and geo-distributed topologies.},

In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multi-hop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose {LEACH} (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster based station (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. {LEACH} uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show the {LEACH} can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional outing protocols. In addition, {LEACH} is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.},

Existing methods have focused on tree-based collaboration, selective activation, and group clustering. This paper presents a prediction-based adaptive algorithm for tracking mobile targets. We use adaptive Kalman filtering to predict the future location and velocity of the target. This location prediction is used to determine the active tracking region which corresponds to the set of sensors that needs to be "lighted". The velocity prediction is used to adaptively determine the size of the active tracking region, and to modulate the sampling rate as well. In this paper, we quantify the benefits of our approach in terms of energy consumed and accuracy of tracking for different mobility patterns. Our simulation results show that advance resource reservation coupled with adaptively changing the size of the active tracking region and the sampling rate reduces the overall energy consumed for tracking without affecting the accuracy in tracking.},

Explicit measurements are often unattractive because the cost of measurement can outweigh the benefits of exploiting proximity information. Vivaldi is a simple, light-weight algorithm that assigns synthetic coordinates to hosts such that the distance between the coordinates of two hosts accurately predicts the communication latency between the hosts. Vivaldi is fully distributed, requiring no fixed network infrastructure and no distinguished hosts. It is also efficient: a new host can compute good coordinates for itself after collecting latency information from only a few other hosts. Because it requires little com-munication, Vivaldi can piggy-back on the communication patterns of the application using it and scale to a large number of hosts. An evaluation of Vivaldi using a simulated network whose latencies are based on measurements among 1740 Internet hosts shows that a 2-dimensional Euclidean model with height vectors embeds these hosts with low error (the median relative error in round-trip time prediction is 11 percent).},

	abstract = {In telecommunication, the free-space path loss ({FSPL}) is the attenuation of radio energy between the feedpoints of two antennas that results from the combination of the receiving antenna's capture area plus the obstacle free, line-of-sight path through free space (usually air). The "Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas", {IEEE} Std 145-1993, defines "free-space loss" as "The loss between two isotropic radiators in free space, expressed as a power ratio." It does not include any power loss in the antennas themselves due to imperfections such as resistance. Free space loss increases with the square of distance between the antennas because the radio waves spread out due the inverse square law and decreases with the square of the wavelength of the radio waves. The {FSPL} is rarely used standalone, but rather as a part of the Friis transmission formula, which includes the gain of antennas. It is a factor that must be included in the power link budget of a radio communication system, to ensure that sufficient radio power reaches the receiver that the transmitted signal is received intelligibly.},

Collaborative microsensors could be very effective in monitoring their operations. However, low power and in-network data processing make data-centric routing in wireless sensor networks a challenging problem. In this paper we propose heuristics to construct and maintain an aggregation tree in sensor networks. This aggregation tree can be used to facilitate data-centric routing. The main idea is to turn off the radio of all leaf nodes to save power, and thereby extending the network lifetime. Therefore, in order to save the number of broadcasting messages, only the nonleaf nodes in the tree are in charge of data aggregation and traffic relaying. In this paper, we propose an efficient energy-aware distributed heuristic to generate the aggregation tree, which we refer to as {EADAT}. Our {EADAT} algorithm makes no assumption on local network topology, and is based on residual power. It makes use of neighboring broadcast scheduling and distributed competition among neighbors. These novel concepts make {EADAT} very efficient and effective, as demonstrated by our simulation experiments with {NS}2.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in processor, memory and radio technology have enabled wireless sensor networks which are deployed to collect useful information from an area of interest. The sensed data must be gathered and transmitted to a base station where it is further processed for end-user queries. Since the network consists of low-cost nodes with limited battery power, power efficient methods must be employed for data gathering and aggregation in order to achieve long network lifetimes.In an environment where in a round of communication each of the sensor nodes has data to send to a base station, it is important to minimize the total energy consumed by the system in a round so that the system lifetime is maximized. With the use of data fusion and aggregation techniques, while minimizing the total energy per round, if power consumption per node can be balanced as well, a near optimal data gathering and routing scheme can be achieved in terms of network lifetime.So far, besides the conventional protocol of direct transmission, two elegant protocols called {LEACH} and {PEGASIS} have been proposed to maximize the lifetime of a sensor network. In this paper, we propose two new algorithms under name {PEDAP} (Power Efficient Data gathering and Aggregation Protocol), which are near optimal minimum spanning tree based routing schemes, where one of them is the power-aware version of the other. Our simulation results show that our algorithms perform well both in systems where base station is far away from and where it is in the center of the field. {PEDAP} achieves between 4x to 20x improvement in network lifetime compared with {LEACH}, and about three times improvement compared with {PEGASIS}.},

(2000) is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. In this paper, we present an improved scheme, called {PEGASIS} (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), which is a near-optimal chain-based protocol that minimizes energy. In {PEGASIS}, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that {PEGASIS} performs better than {LEACH}. For many applications, in addition to minimizing energy, it is also important to consider the delay incurred in gathering sensed data. We capture this with the energy /spl times/ delay metric and present schemes that attempt to balance the energy and delay cost for data gathering from sensor networks. We present two new schemes to minimize energy /spl times/ delay using {CDMA} and non-{CDMA} sensor nodes. We compared the performance of direct, {LEACH}, and our schemes with respect to energy /spl times/ delay using extensive simulations for different network sizes. Results show that our schemes perform 80 or more times better than the direct scheme and also outperform the {LEACH} protocol.},

	abstract = {The responsiveness of networked applications is limited by communications delays, making network distance an important parameter in optimizing the choice of communications peers. Since accurate global snapshots are difficult and expensive to gather and maintain, it is desirable to use sampling techniques in the Internet to predict unknown network distances from a set of partially observed measurements. This paper makes three contributions. First, we present a model for representing and predicting distances in large-scale networks by matrix factorization which can model suboptimal and asymmetric routing policies, an improvement on previous approaches. Second, we describe two algorithms-singular value decomposition and non-negative matrix factorization-for representing a matrix of network distances as the product of two smaller matrices. Third, based on our model and algorithms, we have designed and implemented a scalable system-Internet Distance Estimation Service ({IDES})-that predicts large numbers of network distances from limited samples of Internet measurements. Extensive simulations on real-world data sets show that {IDES} leads to more accurate, efficient and robust predictions of latencies in large-scale networks than existing approaches},

	abstract = {Network coordinate ({NC}) systems provide a lightweight and scalable way for predicting the distances, i.e., round-trip latencies among Internet hosts. Most existing {NC} systems embed hosts into a low dimensional Euclidean space. Unfortunately, the persistent occurrence of Triangle Inequality Violation ({TIV}) on the Internet largely limits the distance prediction accuracy of those {NC} systems. Some alternative systems aim at handling the persistent {TIV}, however, they only achieve comparable prediction accuracy with Euclidean distance based {NC} systems. In this paper, we propose an {NC} system, so-called Phoenix, which is based on the matrix factorization model. Phoenix introduces a weight to each reference {NC} and trusts the {NCs} with higher weight values more than the others. The weight-based mechanism can substantially reduce the impact of the error propagation. Using the representative aggregate data sets and the newly measured dynamic data set collected from the Internet, our simulations show that Phoenix achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy than other {NC} systems. We also show that Phoenix quickly converges to steady state, performs well under host churn, handles the drift of the {NCs} successfully by using regularization, and is robust against measurement anomalies. Phoenix achieves a scalable yet accurate end-to-end distances monitoring. In addition, we study how well an {NC} system can characterize the {TIV} property on the Internet by introducing two new quantitative metrics, so-called {RERPL} and {AERPL}. We show that Phoenix is able to characterize {TIV} better than other existing {NC} systems.},

	abstract = {The knowledge of end-to-end network distances is essential to many Internet applications. As active probing of all pairwise distances is infeasible in large-scale networks, a natural idea is to measure a few pairs and to predict the other ones without actually measuring them. This paper formulates the prediction problem as matrix completion where the unknown entries in a pairwise distance matrix constructed from a network are to be predicted. By assuming that the distance matrix has low-rank characteristics, the problem is solvable by low-rank approximation based on matrix factorization. The new formulation circumvents the well-known drawbacks of existing approaches based on Euclidean embedding. A new algorithm, so-called Decentralized Matrix Factorization by Stochastic Gradient Descent ({DMFSGD}), is proposed. By letting network nodes exchange messages with each other, the algorithm is fully decentralized and only requires each node to collect and to process local measurements, with neither explicit matrix constructions nor special nodes such as landmarks and central servers. In addition, we compared comprehensively matrix factorization and Euclidean embedding to demonstrate the suitability of the former on network distance prediction. We further studied the incorporation of a robust loss function and of nonnegativity constraints. Extensive experiments on various publicly available datasets of network delays show not only the scalability and the accuracy of our approach, but also its usability in real Internet applications.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) now permeates our daily lives, providing important measurement and collection tools to inform our every decision. Millions of sensors and devices are continuously producing data and exchanging important messages via complex networks supporting machine-to-machine communications and monitoring and controlling critical smart-world infrastructures. As a strategy to mitigate the escalation in resource congestion, edge computing has emerged as a new paradigm to solve {IoT} and localized computing needs. Compared with the well-known cloud computing, edge computing will migrate data computation or storage to the network “edge”, near the end users. Thus, a number of computation nodes distributed across the network can offload the computational stress away from the centralized data center, and can significantly reduce the latency in message exchange. In addition, the distributed structure can balance network traffic and avoid the traffic peaks in {IoT} networks, reducing the transmission latency between edge/cloudlet servers and end users, as well as reducing response times for real-time {IoT} applications in comparison with traditional cloud services. Furthermore, by transferring computation and communication overhead from nodes with limited battery supply to nodes with significant power resources, the system can extend the lifetime of the individual nodes. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey, analyzing how edge computing improves the performance of {IoT} networks. We categorize edge computing into different groups based on architecture, and study their performance by comparing network latency, bandwidth occupation, energy consumption, and overhead. In addition, we consider security issues in edge computing, evaluating the availability, integrity, and the confidentiality of security strategies of each group, and propose a framework for security evaluation of {IoT} networks with edge computing. Finally, we compare the performance of various {IoT} applications (smart city, smart grid, smart transportation, and so on) in edge computing and traditional cloud computing architectures.},

The existing clustering techniques exhibit some drawbacks which limit their usage for practical networks. First, cluster heads are typically selected among all sensor nodes within the network, and consequently, unbalanced clusters may be generated. Second, the controllable parameters are defined manually. Third, the protocol is not adjusted and tuned based on application specifications. In this paper, we propose an adaptive fuzzy clustering protocol (named {LEACH}-{SF}), in order to overcome the mentioned drawbacks. In {LEACH}-{SF}, fuzzy c-means algorithm is used to cluster all sensor nodes into balanced clusters, and then appropriate cluster heads are selected via Sugeno fuzzy inference system. The fuzzy inputs of the Sugeno fuzzy inference system include the residual energy, the distance from sink, and the distance from cluster centroid. Unlike the existing fuzzy-based routing protocols in which the fuzzy rule base table is defined manually, we utilize artificial bee colony algorithm to adjust the fuzzy rules of {LEACH}-{SF}. The fitness function of the algorithm is defined to prolong the network lifetime, based on the application specifications. In other words, {LEACH}-{SF} not only prolongs the lifetime, but also is applicable to any kind of application. Simulations over 10 heterogeneous wireless sensor networks show that {LEACH}-{SF} outperforms the existing cluster-based routing protocols.},

Considering these unique characteristics, our network architecture is modelled around a data-centric approach that allows us to make use of in-network processing and data aggregation which in turn helps to maximize network lifetime. This paper suggests methods to improve network efficiency by combining Directed Diffusion [2] with clustering and by introducing a more elaborate data aggregation scheme. Our data aggregation scheme allows nodes to process data collected from sensors and subsequently aggregate the data even in completely unfamiliar environments by including entire query definitions within interest messages.

	abstract = {Large-scale wireless sensor networks are expected to play an increasingly important role in future civilian and military settings. Collaborative microsensors could be very effective in monitoring their operations. However, low power and in-network data processing make data-centric routing in wireless sensor networks a challenging problem. In this paper we propose heuristics to construct and maintain an aggregation tree in sensor networks. This aggregation tree can be used to facilitate data-centric routing. The main idea is to turn off the radio of all leaf nodes to save power, and thereby extending the network lifetime. Therefore, in order to save the number of broadcasting messages, only the nonleaf nodes in the tree are in charge of data aggregation and traffic relaying. In this paper, we propose an efficient energy-aware distributed heuristic to generate the aggregation tree, which we refer to as {EADAT}. Our {EADAT} algorithm makes no assumption on local network topology, and is based on residual power. It makes use of neighboring broadcast scheduling and distributed competition among neighbors. These novel concepts make {EADAT} very efficient and effective, as demonstrated by our simulation experiments with {NS}2.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in processor, memory and radio technology have enabled wireless sensor networks which are deployed to collect useful information from an area of interest. The sensed data must be gathered and transmitted to a base station where it is further processed for end-user queries. Since the network consists of low-cost nodes with limited battery power, power efficient methods must be employed for data gathering and aggregation in order to achieve long network lifetimes.In an environment where in a round of communication each of the sensor nodes has data to send to a base station, it is important to minimize the total energy consumed by the system in a round so that the system lifetime is maximized. With the use of data fusion and aggregation techniques, while minimizing the total energy per round, if power consumption per node can be balanced as well, a near optimal data gathering and routing scheme can be achieved in terms of network lifetime.So far, besides the conventional protocol of direct transmission, two elegant protocols called {LEACH} and {PEGASIS} have been proposed to maximize the lifetime of a sensor network. In this paper, we propose two new algorithms under name {PEDAP} (Power Efficient Data gathering and Aggregation Protocol), which are near optimal minimum spanning tree based routing schemes, where one of them is the power-aware version of the other. Our simulation results show that our algorithms perform well both in systems where base station is far away from and where it is in the center of the field. {PEDAP} achieves between 4x to 20x improvement in network lifetime compared with {LEACH}, and about three times improvement compared with {PEGASIS}.},

	abstract = {Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information Systems ({PEGASIS}) protocol is energy efficient protocols designed to prolong the lifetime of the network by reduction of energy consumption. In this paper a modification is proposed to the {PEGASIS} algorithm where sensor nodes are clustered in groups, clustering is done by k-means algorithm, and each group is treated as {PEGASIS}. In addition the proposed algorithm used rechargeable sensor nodes. Two parameters are searched to select chain leader: Euclidean distance of sensor node to the base station and residual energy of sensor node. Each cluster head data is transmitted directly to the base station. Simulation results showed the proposed algorithms improved in comparison with original {PEGASIS}.},

	abstract = {Sensor webs consisting of nodes with limited battery power and wireless communications are deployed to collect useful information from the field. Gathering sensed information in an energy efficient manner is critical to operate the sensor network for a long period of time. In W. Heinzelman et al. (Proc. Hawaii Conf. on System Sci., 2000), a data collection problem is defined where, in a round of communication, each sensor node has a packet to be sent to the distant base station. If each node transmits its sensed data directly to the base station then it will deplete its power quickly. The {LEACH} protocol presented by W. Heinzelman et al. is an elegant solution where clusters are formed to fuse data before transmitting to the base station. By randomizing the cluster heads chosen to transmit to the base station, {LEACH} achieves a factor of 8 improvement compared to direct transmissions, as measured in terms of when nodes die. In this paper, we propose {PEGASIS} (power-efficient gathering in sensor information systems), a near optimal chain-based protocol that is an improvement over {LEACH}. In {PEGASIS}, each node communicates only with a close neighbor and takes turns transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount of energy spent per round. Simulation results show that {PEGASIS} performs better than {LEACH} by about 100 to 300\% when 1\%, 20\%, 50\%, and 100\% of nodes die for different network sizes and topologies.},
